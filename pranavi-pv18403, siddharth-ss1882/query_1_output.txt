Document Title: Photograph 51 – Noel Coward Theatre, London
Source: PublicReviews.com
Published on: 2015-09-16T10:11:20Z
Document Content: Writer: Anna Ziegler 
 
Director: Michael Grandage 
 
Reviewer:  Andy Moseley 
 
This is a frustrating play. It marks the West End return of one of Hollywood’s finest actors, and it tells the story of the greatest scientific discovery of the 20 th century. There are deception, rivalries, stolen ideas, missed opportunities and personal and professional sacrifices made in the name of science and careers. And yet, for all this, it is still a frustrating play, never quite seeming to do justice either to the story, the central characters, or the acting talent at its disposal. 
 
To get it out of the way at the start, Nicole Kidman is excellent as Rosalind Franklin, capturing the mixture of professional detachment and seeming incomprehension that there was any other way to be, that appears to have been a defining feature of Franklin. Franklin took the photograph that lead to the discovery of the double helix that unlocked the mysteries of DNA and what life is made of. However, she didn’t realise just what it was that she had discovered, or at least did not trust her initial findings sufficiently enough to go public with them in the absence of corroborating evidence. As a result, and in less time than it took her to gather such evidence, photograph 51 was seen by James Watson who, along with Francis Crick, used it, together with data from throughout the scientific community, to unlock the secret and take credit for its discovery. 
 
The focus in Photograph 51 is largely on Franklin and the stubbornness that led to her losing her rightful place in scientific history, as well as alienating many of those around her and possibly ruining her chances of personal happiness. That Franklin was ‘unspeakably difficult’ is stated many times, but the script seldom illustrates this with anything other than pedantry, put downs and an insistence on being correctly referred to. Given her achievements and the dismissive and sexist nature of the male dominated environment she entered in London, these were not unreasonable responses from her. There are hints of more depths to her male contemporaries, but these are not really developed and what we see of them are too often little more than stereotypes serving the story rather than real people. 
 
The brief moments where Franklin drops her guard, allowing PHD student Don Caspar (Patrick Kennedy) to call her an abbreviated version of her first name, or admit to herself about what she lost as a result of her focus on science, add to the strength of Kidman’s portrayal, rounding it out without ever drifting into mawkish sentiment. The problem is that whilst we are seeing this, little is said about any further research she was doing and the race, such as it is, is being won by Watson and Crick without the audience ever really knowing how far she was lagging behind, or how close she may have been. 
 
The scenes combining the loss of that race with the outcome of the relationship with Caspar bring out the sacrifices she made in a very effective way, and the scenes showing how small changes could have lead to very different outcomes give a poignant and powerful ‘what-if’ scenario, but the play as a whole makes too little of the dramatic tension in the scientific story, and does not offer the deeper exploration of the individual at the heart of it that the ending at least alludes to. 
 
It is a good play with an excellent central performance by Kidman, but without the star vehicle behind it, it is unlikely that the play itself would draw anywhere near as much attention as it is receiving.

Document Content: Tens of thousands of people are marching through the streets in a rally supporting the rights of refugees. 
 
Protesters will gather in London's Parliament Square where a number of politicians and pubic figures are due to give speeches. 
 
Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour Party, is expected to make an appearance. 
 
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett are also due to speak. 
 
Musician Billy Bragg, who is performing at the event, said he is "encouraged" by Mr Corbyn's success and added "hopefully this will mean a return to civic culture". 
 
"People are beginning to understand that we do have a lot in common with one another and it's possible to create a society where people's needs are put first," he said. 
 
"The demonisation of people in need that's gone on in this country is not the kind of Britain I grew up in - that everyone who's in need is a scrounger and all refugees are terrorists. 
 
"It's not the compassionate society I want Britain to be seen as around the world."

Document Title: Young Reporter scheme expands to reach all of London
Source: Borehamwood Times
Published on: 2015-09-10T08:56:23Z
Document Content: Newsquest’s Young Reporter scheme is beginning its eighth year, offering students from around the capital the chance to publish their own news stories on to websites visited by thousands daily. 
 
In addition, as well as appearing on all our area-specific websites, the stories will be hosted on thisislocallondon.co.uk, covering every corner of our great city. 
 
Designed to encourage aspiring writers and journalists to think independently, explore and enquire about the world around them and build their confidence, the scheme is open to all schools and colleges in London for pupils aged between 14 and 18. 
 
 
 
 Award winners Katie Harris and Nicola Evans at Newsquest South London offices in Sutton  
 
Students start their “writing career” producing one article a month for a period of eight months and the scheme is carefully structured so that they feel they are working directly for the online newspaper. 
 
They are given deadlines to work to and encouraged to write local articles, take photographs and then upload their work directly to our website. 
 
Judith Forshaw, head of English at Croydon High School, said: “The Young Reporter scheme continues to give our students a unique opportunity to see their articles published for a real audience.” 
   Promoted stories   
At the end of the programme, the students who have completed eight articles receive a letter of recognition from a Newsquest editor, congratulating them on their achievement. 
 
Those who write their articles within the deadlines are given the opportunity to compete against other students to win prizes and spend a day at a London university. 
 
Kingston University hosted the event this year. 
 
 
 
 Young reporters at Kingston University in June  
 
Schools have wholeheartedly endorsed this scheme as it is hard to secure work experience placements in the media and Newsquest organises the entire project, so it can be run with minimal effort from teachers. 
 
Kathryn Pullen, headteacher, Sydenham High School, said: “This is our first year in the scheme and it has been a pleasure to see our girls rising to the challenge and publishing some excellent articles.

“We will definitely be taking part again.” 
 
Schools are now registering for this year. For more information, call Diana Jarvis on 020 8722 6378 or email her at djarvis@ london.newsquest.co.uk.

Document Title: Israeli Prime Minister Provides Target for Protestors in London
Source: Media Line
Published on: 2015-09-09T08:01:04Z
Document Content: Anti-Israel protestors are expected to be out in force on Thursday when Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visits British Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street. A social media campaign that solicited signatures on a petition calling for authorities to arrest Netanyahu for war crimes pursuant to the UK’s third-party war crimes law proved to be a red-herring when it ignored the legal exemption for heads of governments. Nevertheless, some view impact of more than 100,000 signatures a public relations victory and nevertheless a blow to Netanyahu and to Israel. And while demonstrators make their case behind the police barricades, Cameron is expected to apply the diplomatic heat inside when he criticizes Israeli policy of building in areas it acquired in the 1967 war that are claimed by the Palestinians and accuses his counterpart of foot-dragging on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The British government supports the separate labeling of goods originating in the post-1967 territories, a move vehemently opposed by Netanyahu, who will have his own agenda to argue with Cameron. One expected issue is the Iranian nuclear deal and the haste with which the UK re-opened its embassy in Tehran.

Debate Debate thrives on conversation, which is never more engaging than when the world outside the cinema is reflected back at us. This year’s Debate Gala is Stephen Frears’s THE PROGRAM starring Ben Foster as cyclist Lance Armstrong, charting his rise to near canonization and his subsequent fall from grace. Other highlights in this section include: Pablo Larraín’s THE CLUB, a mordant morality tale set in a sleepy Chilean coastal town, which won Berlin’s Grand Jury Prize; CHRONIC, Michel Franco’s uncompromising study of grief and isolation, featuring a revelatory performance by Tim Roth; brothers Tarzan and Arab Nasser’s feature directorial debut, DÉGRADÉ, a smart drama that moves seamlessly between humour and despair, set in a women’s hair salon in Gaza; the European Premiere of George Amponsah’s intimate documentary THE HARD STOP, revealing the story of Mark Duggan’s friends and family following his death after being shot in a ‘Hard Stop’ police procedure in 2011; Jonas Carpignano’s engrossing feature debut, THE MEASURE OF A MAN which won Vincent Lindon Best Actor at Cannes Film Festival, MEDITERRANEA, an ultra-topical tale of two young African men from Burkina Faso who, in search of a better life, make the difficult and dangerous trip across the Sahara desert and Mediterranean Sea to reach Italy; the drama MUCH LOVED, Nabil Ayouch’s searing, no-holds-barred look at the world of prostitution in Morocco; David Evans’ thought-provoking documentary MY NAZI LEGACY, which raises the harrowing question, ‘What if your father was a Nazi?’; the World Premiere of John Dower’s MY SCIENTOLOGY MOVIE which features Louis Theroux as he heads to Los Angeles to explore the Church of Scientology; Sebastián Silva’s beguiling, seductive and confrontational NASTY BABY; PAULINA, Santiago Mitre’s intelligent parable for contemporary Argentina, which won the Critics Week Grand Prize in Cannes; TAKLUB, Brillante Ma Mendoza’s riveting ode to a Filipino city wreaked by a typhoon; and Jafar Panahi’s latest film, TAXI TEHRAN, winner of the Golden Bear at this year’s Berlinale and set and shot from inside a car.

The Dare Gala is Yorgos Lanthimos’ THE LOBSTER which stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Coleman, John C. Reilly, Léa Sedoux and Ben Whishaw in a bleakly hilarious skewering of fundamentalist diktats and rituals that is also a tender plea for genuine intimacy amid society’s self-imposed absurdities. Other highlights in this strand include: Miguel Gomes’ mixes fantasy, documentary, docu-fiction, Brechtian pantomime and echoes of MGM musical in the epic ARABIAN NIGHTS; the World Premiere of William Fairman and Max Gogarty’s CHEMSEX, an unflinching, powerful documentary about the pleasures and perils associated with the ‘chemsex’ scene that’s far more than a sensationalist exposé; the European Premiere of CLOSET MONSTER, Stephen Dunn’s remarkable debut feature about an artistic, sexually confused teen who has conversations with his pet hamster, voiced by Isabella Rossellini; THE ENDLESS RIVER a devasting new film set in small-town South Africa from Oliver Hermanus, Diep Hoang Nguyen’s beautiful debut, FLAPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, a wry, weird socially probing take on the teen pregnancy scenario that focuses on a girl whose escape from village life to pursue an urban education has her frozen in mid-flight; LUCIFER, Gust Van den Berghe’s thrillingly cinematic tale of Lucifer as an angel who visits a Mexican village, filmed in ‘Tondoscope’ – a circular frame in the centre of the screen; the European premiere of KOTHANODI a compelling, unsettling fairytale from India; veteran Algerian director Merzak Allouache’s gritty and delicate portrait of a drug addicted petty thief in MADAME COURAGE; Radu Muntean’s excellent ONE FLOOR BELOW, which combines taut, low-key realism with incisive psychological and ethical insights in a drama centering on a man, his wife and a neighbor; and QUEEN OF EARTH, Alex Ross Perry’s devilish study of mental breakdown and dysfunctional power dynamics between female best friends, starring Elisabeth Moss. Laugh This year’s Laugh strand encompasses richly diverse geography, subject matter and senses of humour, from gleeful to bittersweet and wickedly satirical. This year’s Laugh Gala is the European Premiere of BRAND: A SECOND COMING, an energetic, complex and frequently hilarious documentary about Russell Brand directed by Ondi Timoner.

Thrill This year’s Thrill strand features nerve-shredders that’ll get your adrenalin pumping and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Gala presentation for this strand is the International Premiere of Deepa Mehta’s BEEBA BOYS, an energetic gangster movie that also explores South Asian family values set in Vancouver’s Sikh immigrant badlands and starring Randeep Hooda. Other highlights in this section include: the European Premiere of Choi Dong-hoon’s colourful period bullet opera, ASSASSINATION; the European Premiere of Daniel Junge’s thrill-a-minute BEING EVEL about the legendary daredevil Robert Craig ‘Evel’ Knievel; the European Premiere of David Farr’s crafty and suspenseful study in paranoia, THE ONES BELOW starring David Morrissey and Clémence Poésy; Atom Egoyan’s latest drama REMEMBER, offering a provocative study of the nature of evil as well as serving as a stark reminder of the atrocities of 20th century history, starring Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau; Gabriel Clarke and John McKenna’s gripping documentary STEVE MCQUEEN: THE MAN & LE MANS, featuring unseen archive footage, contemporary interviews and previously unheard commentary from McQueen himself; Stephen Fingleton’s thrilling, post-apocalyptic debut THE SURVIVALIST; Sebastian Schipper’s exhilarating one-shot sensation, VICTORIA; and THE WAVE, Roar Uthaug’s high-octane and nerve-shredding portrayal of a potential catastrophe. Cult In the Cult strand, the dark side is welcomed with outcasts and reprobates taking centre stage in this year’s crop of films. The Cult Gala is the International Premiere of S. Craig Zahler’s gloriously imaginative genre hybrid BONE TOMAHAWK starring Kurt Russell in a film with enough surprises to satisfy even the most jaded horror hounds and western fans. Other highlights in this strand include: the World Premiere of Thierry Poiraud’s DON’T GROW UP, a stylish and inventive film about a group of teens on an unnamed island who wake up to find their youth facility eerily abandoned; the World Premiere of Jon Spira’s affectionate documentary ELSTREE 1976 about the bit performers who appeared in George Lucas’ box office behemoth Star Wars; GHOST THEATER, the latest film from director Hideo Nakata, the forerunner of J-horror; GREEN ROOM, Jeremy Saulnier’s latest exercise in edge of the seat suspense, starring Patrick Stewart, Imogen Poots and Anton Yelchin; returning for the third year running, Sion Sono screens LOVE AND PEACE, his tale of punk rock and talking turtles; and the fantastically prolific Takashi Miike’s riotous, unruly gangster vampire concoction YAKUZA APOCALYPSE. Journey Journey is all about the temporal voyage. This year’s Journey Gala is Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s breathtakingly elegant and mesmerizing first foray into wuxia (martial arts), THE ASSASSIN, which won him the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year.

Experimenta Experimenta, the LFF showcase of experimental cinema and artist moving image is programmed in partnership with LUX for a third year and is supported by the Arts Council England. Focused on films and videos by artists, it aims to screen films that use the moving image to change the way we think of film and how it functions. The Experimenta Special Presentation is THE FORBIDDEN ROOM, a gleeful, hypnotic and totally deranged epic directed by Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson. An extensive selection of work from across the world is presented including the World Premieres of William English’s HEATED GLOVES and THE HOST, in which director Miranda Pennell delves deeper into her past and her late parents’ involvement with the Anglo Iranian Oil Company (BP); Ben Rivers’ THE SKY TREMBLES AND THE EARTH IS AFRAID AND THE TWO EYES ARE NOT BROTHERS, the feature element of Ben’s current Artangel installation at BBC White City; EVENT FOR A STAGE by Tacita Dean, a filmed presentation of her live theatrical happening in collaboration with actor Stephen Dillane at the 2014 Sydney Biennial; the European Premiere of Omer Fast’s REMAINDER, a London-set thriller adapted from Tom McCarthy’s acclaimed novel of the same name; the European Premiere of INVENTION which highlights the possibilities of camera movement and the development of artistic apparatus and Kevin Jerome Everson’s PARK LANES, set in an American bowling alley over the course of a day. Shorts A hugely diverse range of original and exciting short films that will captivate audiences span the festival strands this year. Films of Love and Devotion explores and attempts to explain the old adage that the course of true love never did run smooth with Rob Savage’s ABSENCE starring Paul McGann as a grieving man and OFFLINE DATING, a documentary about a single man’s search for love without the use of the internet. The Last Man Standing is a Girl programme explores the role of young women in society with GROOVE IS IN THE HEART, a tale of music and memory revealed through a school girl’s mixtape and A GIRL’S DAY from German director Hannah Ziegler. The Family at War shorts attempts to show what families are really like and how we survive them with TAMARA by Sofia Safonova and VIDEO where we see Elaine having trouble balancing life between her teenage daughter and a secret evening job. Funny How? How am I Funny? explores the comedy in cultural misunderstanding with OTHRWISE ENGAGED and black comedy KUNG FURY. The Fight or Flight programme charts the human response to extreme situations and Wild at Heart and Weird on Top presents eleven shorts that explore the history of film. In the Neighborhood is human stories of love, death and life-changing moments and includes Oscar Hudson’s LORD AND LIDL, where God unexpectedly shows up at the supermarket. London Calling is a selection of shorts from some of the capital’s most exciting new filmmakers and is supported by Film London. Sound Mirrors features nine diverse shorts all on a musical theme and Animated Shorts for Younger Audiences bring together a mix of exciting stories from around the world to surprise and delight children and adults alike. Treasures Treasures bring recently restored cinematic riches from archives around the world to the Festival in London. The previously announced Archive Gala is the World Premiere of the BFI National Archive restoration of A.V. Bramble and Anthony Asquith’s silent film SHOOTING STARS (1928), presented with a new live score by John Altman, BAFTA and Emmy award-winning composer whose work includes Titanic and Goldeneye. Asquith’s feature debut not only announced the arrival of a significant new director, it is an exuberant, joyful pastiche of the movie industry and is a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse and searing comment on the shallowness of the star system. The film restoration and new score is supported by a number of generous individuals, trusts and organisations. A number of other major restorations will have their World Premieres at the Festival: Carol Reed’s atmospheric Graham Greene adaptation of OUR MAN IN HAVANA (1959), set in Cuba at the start of the Cold War, makes timely viewing as US/Cuba relations thaw; Ken Russell’s reworking of D.H. Lawrence scandalous classic WOMEN IN LOVE (1970) stars Oliver Reed, Alan Bates and Glenda Jackson and shows two couple’s contrasting searches for love, and was restored by the BFI National Archive working alongside cinematographer Billy Williams; A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966) is directed by Fred Zinnemann from a script by great British screenwriter, Robert Bolt from Bolt’s play about Sir Thomas More, a perfect companion piece to Wolf Hall; Henry Fonda stars in the ripe-for-discovery WARLOCK (1959), a seething study of vengeance and repressed sexuality in a Utah mining outpost; and Bryan Forbes’ THE RAGING MOON (1971) starring Malcolm McDowell and Nanette Newman in a tender story between two young people in wheelchairs which was ahead of its time in its attempts to change attitudes to disability. From newsreels to comedy sketches, the 21 films that make up MAKE MORE NOISE! SUFFRAGETTES IN FILM (1934) are a historical accompaniment to our Opening Night film and a fascinating representation of women at the time that the battle for universal suffrage was being fought on the streets. Martin Scorsese said of Ousmane Sembène’s BLACK GIRL (1966): ‘An astonishing movie – so ferocious, so haunting and so unlike anything we’d ever seen. ’Sembène’s first feature, which tells the tragic story of Diouana, a young Senegalese women eager to find a better life, draws from the Nouvelle Vague, but the film’s heart and soul is definitely African. It is the perfect companion to Samba Gadjigo’s documentary SEMBÈNE! And for a lighter-hearted but no less majestic cinema experience, George Sidney’s breathlessly delightful KISS ME KATE (1953) brings the Cole Porter penned musical to screen, here in magnificent 3D. Rock and roll hall-of-famer Leon Russell is the heart of an ineffable, joyous collage of mesmerising live performance and vérité realism in A POEM IS A NAKED PERSON (1974), filmed between 1972-1974 by director Les Blank. Previously unavailable theatrically in the four decades since it was made. Other highlights include Mira Nair’s Oscar-nominated debut feature SALAAM BOMBAY! (1988); the Holy Grail of silent comedy shorts, a previously-thought-lost Laurel and Hardy THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY (1927), and Luchino Visconti’s fully restored masterpiece ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS (1960), starring Alain Delon in a grand emotional opus on imploding fraternal tensions.

Document Content: Former Akwa Ibom state governor Godswill Akpabio, who is currently in the UK to get treatment after surviving a car crash in Abuja on August 31st, suffered embarrassment at Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a luxury five-star hotel in the Knightsbridge area of London after his credit card was declined while he attempted to check into the hotel.
According to Sahara reporters who released the photos, Akpabio was heard making a call to a banker in Lagos state eiquiring why his card was declined. When SR contacted him, Akpabio said his card was declined because he had used the card to check out of the Four Seasons luxury hotel earlier in the day. Akpabio stated that his credit card had maxed out of its daily spending limit, hence he could not make use of it.

Document Title: Young Reporter scheme goes London-wide with an exciting opportunity for students
Source: St Albans and Harpenden Review
Published on: 2015-09-14T10:10:22Z
Document Content: The Young Reporter scheme starts up again this month for the eighth year running and is open to students from years 10 to 13. This is a fantastic chance for young people  to write and publish their articles on a real live online newspaper, viewed by over 700,000 people per month worldwide. 
 
Schools have totally endorsed this scheme as it is hard to secure work experience placements in the media and it gives students a chance to start their ‘writing career’ under the guidance of professional journalists. 
 
David Plummer, principal, Notre Dame School, said: “Our students have found the scheme provides a superb outlet, somewhat different from their normal school work, to tackle issues pertinent to their own interests.” 
 
Students are given deadlines and encouraged to write local articles and take photographs, all of which are published on News Shopper and also  This Is Local London , our online newspaper covering the areas around the capital. 
 
Katie Harris, from Croydon High School who was one of our top winners this year, said: "The Young Reporter scheme has been such a rewarding and inspiring experience. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in journalism." 
 
Supported by several universities, the scheme has grown in size from two schools, who piloted it back in 2008, to 93 schools who took part during this past year. 
   
 Share article  
   
Stuart Bird, writer in residence, Surbiton High School, added: “Young Reporters is unique. It's independent, it's tough, it's real. It takes commitment and dedication to complete it. And for exactly those reasons, students respect it and love it.” 
 
Schools are now registering for this coming year and applications need to be submitted by October 9. For more information or to sign up for 2015/16, please contact Diana Jarvis – djarvis@london.newsquest.co.uk

Document Title: £480 gets you a bed, in a shed, in a living room, because London is the worst place on Earth
Source: Entertainment Ireland
Published on: 2015-09-04T00:00:00Z
Document Content: We'll never complain about Dublin rental prices ever again. 

This 'room', was advertised on SquareRoom.co.uk for £480 a month, plus bills. To be fair, that's pretty reasonable seeing as it's in Bethnall Green. Actually it's kind of a steal, seeing as it's "the biggest room in the house". 

Well, it'd be a steal if it wasn't for one problem. It's not a room, it's a mattress in a shed, situated inside the living room. 

We've heard of people sharing a room, but sharing a room with literally everybody else in the house is new to us. The room "comes with a sofa which means sharing it with the rest of us sometimes". Emm...no thanks. 

We'd hate to see the state of the other rooms if this really is the biggest. Maybe they're just tents, or outhouses.

Document Title: Summer 2015 Restaurant Roundup

Published on: 2015-08-03T11:00:19Z
Document Content: Rooftop seating at Taverna Agora 
  
This summer, there have been some big time openings in the downtown Raleigh Eats scene. One of them even puts us in the Guinness Book of World Records. 
 
For a complete list of eats, drinks, and coffees in and around downtown, make sure to bookmark the DT Eats page . Try something new! 
 
First, here’s a flier for a new pop up sandwich shop, Linus and Pepper’s, that will be open for three weeks on Salisbury Street starting today. It’ll be student run and is backed by Jon Seelbinder ( Level Up Kitchen and Barcadium , The Architect ) who also is working on other projects in downtown. Read more about it in the N&O . 
 

  Pictured above is the rooftop seating at the new location for Taverna Agora . The restaurant moved from North Raleigh to 326 Hillsborough Street and that empty, shell of a building is now more lively than ever.  Ashley Christensen’s Death and Taxes has finally opened at the corner of Salisbury and Hargett Streets.  Christensen has also announced that she is working on a pizza restaurant that will be located next door to Poole’s Diner .  Now that the Charter Square south tower is complete , we’re waiting to see what Eschelon Experiences brings to one of the ground-floor spaces in the building.  Construction fencing is up where Whiskey Kitchen will go at the corner of McDowell and Martin Streets.  Near Person Street, Standard Foods may actually open. At least that’s what they say as they are now hiring.  Person Street Pharmacy has finished their makeover with a new cafe.   

  
Photo of the back patio at the Raleigh Beer Garden a few days before opening. 
   In Glenwood South, Niall Hanley and Cliff Bleszinski have set a Guinness World Record for most beer taps. The Raleigh Beer Garden is now open and has 366 beer taps spread across two floors. The place is huge and should be quite a draw within and outside the city.  In 510 Glenwood, Big Boom is now open. The new restaurant is from Vincent Barresi, of Vincent’s Italian Cuisine fame in North Raleigh.  JMR Kitchens ( Taste , The Oak ) is opening up more. on West Street in the former Mantra location. The new restaurant will serve “Italian-inspired small plates.”  Near Moore Square, Treat is now open and serves Maple View Farm ice cream.  I’m still keeping track of Provenance , planned to open in the Skyhouse Apartments building.  The N&O reported that Larry’s Beans is opening up a retail shop in the same building.  Still in Skyhouse, Taz is opening up a convenience store (as he does) called Oak City Market.  A dive bar called Ruby Deluxe is opening on the 400 block of Fayetteville Street.  Renovation work is taking place at 313 West Hargett Street. Twitter chatter says a wine bar is in the works.  Zinda has dropped their restaurant concept and is focusing on being an event space and club.

Document Title: Creating an Ergonomic Space (with Style)
Source: MichellePhan.com
Published on: 2015-08-27T10:14:25Z
Document Content: I spend a lot of time using must-have apps, editing videos and catching up on other work, which means I spend hours in front of a computer. It also means my wrist, back and eyes can start feeling strained if I’m not sitting properly or optimizing my desk space. It’s so important to treat your body right while in front of a screen. Thanks to the sexy world of ergonomics, we now have the techniques (I’ve talked about proper desk posture here ) and the products that can make your workspace very body-friendly. But because we don’t want to sacrifice style as well, I thought I’d take today to highlight some ways to ergo up your desk top so you can prevent premature tech aches and pains. 
 

 
Laptop Stand – The days of desktop computers as our main squeeze are more scarce than ever. We use our laptops as our everyday computer, which tends to have us staring down at the monitor. That’s no good! A laptop stand like this Elago L3 (or even their L4) is perfect for bringing your monitor up to eye level so your neck gets a break (no pun intended). The L3 is so sleek and minimalistic so it’s barely noticeable underneath your laptop–a feature I love so the desktop can maintain an uncluttered appearance. When you use the stand, just make sure your laptop is set a distance from your eyes that keeps you from leaning into your computer, but also not strain your eyes from being too close. 
 
External Keyboard and Mouse - Again, because the laptop is always by our side, it’s REALLY important to use external devices if you’re in front of your computer for extended hours. Using the built-in trackpad regularly can cause severe cramping. A portable keyboard is necessary when you have your laptop raised to eye level–on a stand your arms won’t be able to maintain a 90 degree angle. A great mouse will hold your hand in a more natural position for long-term use. I’m a big fan of even using a tablet because it can act as a mouse and is excellent for my creative projects. Have a little fun with your keyboard and mouse and add a pop of color like the turquoise Topcase USB mouse or Azio HUE pink keyboard (or this rainbow light one ! WHAT!). You can also go ultra sleek with all white like the Apple Magic mouse . 
 
Desk Lamp - The position of your body and how your hands lay aren’t the only concern with your desk, lighting is important too. Screen brightness and the type of light in your office can really cause eye strain. Add a minimalistic LED light to your desk to brighten up your space and give your eyes a softer, but still brilliant light, to highlight your work. Poppin makes such fun and clean desktop items and their Limber LED Task Lamp is no different. Two tips to keep in mind when adding a lamp: set the height around 15 inches above your desktop to help the light spread evenly across your workspace, and place the lamp on the opposite side of your desk than your dominate hand so you don’t cast shadows every time you place your hand in front of the light. 
 
Chair - Remember how, in my posture article , I talked about the importance of a chair that supports your back and adjusts so your feet can touch the ground? So yeah, that’s vital. It will keep you from overcorrecting your posture, leading to more strain, and eliminate any knee issues. A great chair will actually lift up so you’re close enough to the desk that your arms are at a 90 degree angle for typing, but low enough that alone or with the help of a foot stool your feet are resting flat. I tend to switch from on my bed to a comfy desk chair once I realize I’m going to be on my laptop for a prolonged period. This Malta Office Chair is white and bright and a comfy but professional option for dressing up your desk and pampering your body. 
 
Bonus: If you don’t want to invest in an external mouse or keyboard and/or you do and want added support then think about getting a wrist rest to support your wrist better. It doesn’t hurt that Socksmakeover might possibly sell the CUTEST wrist rests ever. Look at this little kitty rest ! This can most definitely be a personality piece–something to think about when decorating your desk .

SAN DIEGO -- After missing all of last week, including Saturday's game against the Seattle Seahawks with a shoulder issue, San Diego Chargers inside linebacker Manti Te'o returned to practice on Monday.
"It's a long camp, so coach just gave me the time to recover and get ready, so I feel good," Te'o said.
Te'o has missed at least one preseason game due to injury his first three years in the league, and missed a combined nine games over the last two years due to foot issues.
But Te'o said he could have played against the Seattle Seahawks last week if it were a regular-season game, and that he's healthy enough to play when the Chargers take on the Detroit Lions in the season opener on Sept. 13.
"I'm ready to go," Te'o said. "More importantly, I'm more mentally ready to go. Physically, I feel great. But mentally I'm way more prepared."
Te'o does not know if he'll play in San Diego's final exhibition game on the road against the San Francisco 49ers.
Receiver Dontrelle Inman also returned to practice after missing all of last week with a concussion.
Quarterback Philip Rivers, who suffered an injury to his throwing hand against Seattle, suited up for practice, but just handed off a few times and did not throw during the early portion of practice available to reporters.
Rivers said after the game that his hand is fine and he could have played in the second half against the Seahawks if it were a regular-season game.
Outside linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu did not practice on Monday, and appeared to suffer a right leg injury in the first half against the Seahawks.
Cornerback Chris Davis has not practiced since sustaining a concussion in the preseason opener against the Dallas Cowboys in Aug. 13.
Guard Orlando Franklin returned to practice, but was limited. Others who did not practice include receiver Torrence Allen, guard Johnnie Troutman, center Chris Watt, outside linebacker Tourek Williams, cornerback Greg Ducre, safety Gordon Hill and inside linebacker Kavell Conner.

Document Title: This is what happens when officials don't get prosecuted for illegally torturing people
Source: Freedom of the Press Foundation
Published on: 2015-08-14T18:49:07Z
Document Content: Well, I guess this is a thing now…people running for president musing about whether they might reintroduce the torture techniques Obama “prohibited” when he took office. The latest is Jeb Bush; three years ago, it was candidate Romney. The fact that torture is framed by these candidates as a policy choice, and the possibility that one of them might in fact reintroduce it, is one of Obama’s chief legacies. He chose not to prosecute torture as a crime, instead banning it (or some of it, anyway) via executive order. As I’ve said before: Obama has no more power to prohibit torture than Bush had to permit it. Torture is illegal in America. The law, not the president, is what prohibits torture. What would you make of it if the president said, “That is why I prohibited murder. That is why I prohibited rape. That is why I prohibited embezzlement, and mail fraud, and tax evasion…” In America, the president doesn’t make the law, nor does he rescind it. The president executes the law—which is why Article 2 of the Constitution is called “The Executive Branch.” Presidents who make and rescind laws at will are more commonly known as kings. Remember: what one president by fiat prohibits, another at his or her pleasure can permit. Anyone who cheers Obama’s torture “ban” is missing the insidious, long-term effect of that ban…and could probably use a refresher course on civics, too. Torture: de jure illegal; de facto policy. Remember Hope and Change? No, it hasn’t gone away. It’s just become a punch line.

Most Spider Mites, especially the Two Spotted Spider mite love hot weather and dry conditions, so the race is on!  Batten down the hatches and Katie bar the door, it’s Spider Mite season! 
 
Spider mites attack a variety of plants in your landscape including Burning Bush, Dwarf Alberta Spruce, Boxwood, almost all spruce varieties and other plants. 
 
But they are tiny!  Tiny, destructive creatures that easily move around in your plants undetected because they are so small you don’t notice them.  They are only 1/50 of an inch long in their adult stage.  That’s small! 
 
Then they often hang out on the underside of the foliage feeding away like thieves in the night. 
 
So how can you tell if you have them?  Look for tiny yellow spots on the leaves and needles of your plants.  Spider mites have tiny mouths that are designed to suck the juice out of  individual plant cells.  So they attack your plants one cell at at time and the damage really doesn’t start to show up until they have destroyed the majority of cells on a leaf or an area of the plant. 
 
If you hold a piece of white paper under a branch that you are concerned about, then sharply wrap the branch with a pencil you might knock some off onto to the paper where you can see them.  But you really have to look closely because they look like walking dust particles. 
 
Since they like it hot and dry you can actually blast them off your plants with a sharp stream of water from the garden hose.  Or you can spray your plants with an insecticidal soap that will get rid of the mites but not harm your plants.

Spider mites can completely defoliate a large Burning Bush, but fortunately the plant is usually not permanently damaged.  They also do a lot of damage to Dwarf Alberta Spruce, and the damage there is more permanent. 
 
Keep an eye out for them and give them a good hosing.

Document Title: Foreign Investors Enabled to Own Shares in UAE’s National Telecommunication Company

Document Content: FinanceInvestments Foreign Investors Enabled to Own Shares in UAE’s National Telecommunication Company
August 20, 2015
Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter In an historic move, UAE Federal Law No. 01 of 1991 has been amended by Federal Decree by Law No. 03 of 2015, and new Articles of Association have been issued by the UAE Cabinet of Ministers. The amendments introduce momentous changes, including the possibility of foreign investors owning shares in Etisalat Group, while Etisalat’s legal name will change to Emirates Telecommunications Group Company PJSC, but will continue to be known as Etisalat Group.
These changes allow for legal persons, including institutions, in the United Arab Emirates, or UAE government agencies, or other legal persons, to own shares in Etisalat. Also, non-national individuals and entities may own up to 20 percent of Etisalat Group’s shares, subject to the approval of the Etisalat Group Board of Directors. However, restrictions in respect of voting rights shall be applied to the shares owned by non-nationals and such shares shall not hold any voting rights at Etisalat Group’s general assembly although holders of such shares may attend general assembly meetings.
Commenting on the changes, Eissa Al Suwaidi, Chairman, Etisalat Group, said, “The approval to allow institutional and foreign ownership of Etisalat Group’s equity will have a positive impact for both Etisalat Group’s shareholders and the Stock Exchange. It also sends out a strong signal that the UAE is open for business and will enhance Etisalat brand recognition around the world.”
In addition to ordinary shares, a “Special Share” will be issued to the Federal Government of the UAE (the “Special Shareholder”), pursuant to the approval of Etisalat Group’s Board of Directors. Etisalat Group will also be entitled to issue different classes of shares. Other than the issuance of the Special Share, Etisalat Group does not intend to issue any additional shares at this time.
Ahmad Julfar, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etisalat, added that the move will enable Etisalat to continue to invest in the innovative products and services which customers demand and are vital in the highly competitive global telecommunications sector.
“As a result, I am confident that Etisalat will go from strength to strength and continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders,” he said.
Some of the other material changes include the ability for Etisalat Group to establish a new operating company for the purpose of operating its telecommunications network business and providing telecommunication services in the UAE, subject to Special Shareholder approval, and establishing a share buyback programme at any time in accordance with the conditions and procedures set out in the relevant law and subject to the prior approval of the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.
In accordance with the new law, Etisalat Group will carry out the procedures required to implement and align its status with the provisions of the new law within one year from the date of its issue.

Document Title: Will Work For Adventure
Source: Blue Ridge Outdoors Magazine
Published on: 2015-08-13T15:00:40Z
Document Content: Most of us can only dream about living in a world where we get paid to do what we love, but having an awesome job doesn’t have to be a stretch of the imagination. The following six individuals have made their passions their life, and with a little creativity and a lot of hard work, you can too. 
 
Get inspired and then tell us—if you could make a living in the outdoors, what would you choose to do? 
 
Emily Shanblatt 
 
>> Outdoor Director, French Broad River Academy for Girls 
 
Asheville, N.C. 
 
Chemistry and outdoor leadership. Those were 27-year-old Emily Shanblatt’s two majors when she graduated from Warren Wilson College in western North Carolina. Though Shanblatt did teach chemistry for a year, it was eventually her love of whitewater kayaking that took priority, leading her to the steep creeks of California all the way around the world to the big water of Nepal. 
 
“In college, I discovered a kayak can take you to places you never even imagined,” says Shanblatt, now a sponsored paddler for Confluence. “Your whole world opens up.” 
 
Shanblatt taught women’s kayaking clinics for friend and fellow paddler Anna Levesque’s program Girls At Play, and helped with the French Broad River Academy (FBRA), an Asheville-based middle school for boys specializing in adventure education. Shanblatt’s vision of what she wanted to do with her life was starting to take shape. Conveniently for her, so too was an all-girls version of the French Broad River Academy, which will begin its first year of operation this fall with Shanblatt at the helm as Outdoor Director and math teacher. 
 
“Every Thursday, we don’t step foot in the classroom. We go paddling as much as we can when weather and water levels cooperate,” which, when you’re in the Southeast, is practically year-round. 
 
An all-girls middle school that focuses on whitewater canoeing, of all things, sounds pretty progressive, pretty niche, but Shanblatt’s in charge of 18 girls already, which makes her hopeful for the future of not just the program, but the girls themselves. 
 
“More and more women are running class V and kayaking. The more women these girls can see reaching those higher levels, that’s really powerful,” Shanblatt says. “To give our students an option to explore those things is really valuable. Every girl needs to know that she’s capable of what she wants to do.” 
 

 
Pat Goodman 
 
>> Professional climber 
 
Fayetteville, W.Va. 
 
The view from Pat Goodman’s office is rarely the same, but it’s usually about four inches from his face, hard, and kinda gray. That is, until he turns around and takes in the expanse of remote Canadian (or Chinese or Venezuelan or Indian) backcountry from his perch some 2,000 feet up on a rock face. 
 
“The big appeal [of rock climbing] is getting into a remote location and experiencing an area that few, if any, people have ever visited,” Goodman says. “It’s a pretty surreal experience to go to a place like that.” 
 
Goodman, 37, works hard for those moments. Back in 2012 during his fifth trip to the Vampire Spires in northwestern Canada, Goodman and his team of three navigated 100 miles of the notoriously rowdy Nahanni River by raft just to reach the base of an 800-meter wall, The Phoenix, which was then-unclimbed. And the adventure was only beginning. They then successfully made the first free ascent, tackling an 18-pitch route they later dubbed The Phreenix rated VI 5.11. 
 
As romantic as it sounds, bushwhacking through exotic landscapes and living in a bivy doesn’t necessarily pay the bills. When Goodman’s not racking up first descents, he stays busy with hardwood flooring jobs back at his home in the New River Gorge. 
 
“Maintaining a positive income is definitely a challenge,” Goodman admits, but with a little help from his sponsors Outdoor Research, LaSportiva, Big Agnes, Metolius, Julbo, Probar, and Mountainsmith, Goodman’s able to travel the world on a never-ending quest for the next big ascent. 
 
Aside from The Phreenix, Goodman has been on first ascent teams defying the unlikely close to home and far away, from a V.11 boulder problem in Linville, N.C., called Roadside Distraction, to Daugou Peak in China’s Shuangquiao Valley. 
 
Though he’s experienced cultures and foods, traditions and settings of nearly every variety, his favorite part about his job is simple. 
 
“The climbing. That’s why I do it.” 
 

 
Eva Surls 
 
>> Mountain bike guide and co-owner, The Bike Farm 
 
Brevard, N.C. 
 
Cradled by the lush green expanse of Pisgah National Forest, The Bike Farm sits on 440 acres just outside of Brevard, N.C., a small town with a big reputation as the Cycling Capital of the South. With hundreds of miles of technical singletrack right out her backdoor, and a husband for a coworker, co-owner and guide Eva Surls sometimes has to pinch herself—is this really where she lives, works, and plays? 
 
“I grew up in east Texas in piney woods, kinda like the eastern part of North Carolina actually,” Surls says, “but I fell in love with this area, the water, the green, and I definitely fell in love with the mountain biking here.” 
 
Together, Surls and her husband Cashion Smith started The Bike Farm in the fall of 2012 as “a community-style hub that people could come gather at, ride bikes, and experience nature and healthy living.” In the early stages, however, there was no “farm,” per say. There was just a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter that Surls and Smith lived and guided out of full-time. 
 
“Owning or starting a business is definitely challenging,” Surls says. “You’re married to it. You don’t leave it at the office because your home is the office.” 
 
Still, for Surls, whose family encouraged her to pursue adventure sports at an early age, helping others experience biking is a dream come true. When she isn’t in the saddle guiding women or beginners around Pisgah’s elaborate trail system, she’s donning another hat as marketing director or perhaps event coordinator, maybe business manager—when your business has no full-time staff, you make do. But Surls doesn’t seem to mind, for at the end of the day, her mission with The Bike Farm is simple: get people outside. 
 
“I really believe that part of health is experiencing nature and the future of the planet depends on humans interacting with it and realizing the value in it as its own entity,” she adds. “Guiding was an avenue that I saw to get people out into nature…and also experiencing their own body.” 
 

 
Bryan Mangum 
 
>> Road warrior, Eagles Nest Outfitters 
 
Asheville, N.C. 
 
If you ever meet Bryan Mangum, you’ll likely find him at any of the region’s major music festivals relaxing in a hammock, feet propped up, swaying in time with the music. Add some palm trees and a margarita and that sounds damn near like a vacation, but don’t be fooled—Mangum’s on the clock for Eagles Nest Outfitters, or ENO. His job? Road warrior, a fierce title for someone whose main job responsibilities include setting up hammocks, selling hammocks, and of course, relaxing in hammocks, too. 
 
“The festivals can be anywhere from the Florida Keys all the way up to New York,” Mangum says of his territory. “Some people may only see bands once in their lifetime, where I get to see them sometimes four times throughout a summer.” 
 
Like representing a cool outdoorsy brand and chilling in hammocks all day wasn’t sweet enough, Mangum also gets to see some of his favorite artists perform like Phil Lesh and Friends, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, and Slightly Stoopid, just to name a few. 
 
“The music is definitely a perk of the job,” Mangum, 28, says. “An even bigger perk of the job is when your booth is set up in front of the stage.” 
 
Rough life, right? But setting up an armada of hammocks and manning a booth for four days straight requires a lot of patience, people skills, and, believe it or not, physical strength. The ENO booth takes Mangum two hours, sometimes more, to set up by himself, but if there’s one thing he’s learned during his yearlong stint of working the festival circuit, it’s this: be kind to your neighbors. 
 
“You’re always gonna need help no matter what,” Mangum says. 
 
Though he’s had some great festival neighbors over the past year like Sierra Nevada and Kitchen Craft, who fed him throughout the weekend, Mangum’s favorite neighbor would have to be a friendly girl by the name of Ashley, who worked the non-profit Rock the Earth’s booth at Mountain Jams in 2014. 
 
“She sat in a hammock and we talked for three days straight,” Mangum says. 
 
     Because really, what other ingredients do you need for falling in love beyond hammocks, tunes, and conversation? 
 

 
Zach Adams 
 
>> Trail builder, Heart of the Highlands Trail System 
 
Canaan Valley, W.Va. 
 
Zach Adams, 25, doesn’t have to worry about donning a suit and tie for his job. In fact, he could get away with wearing the same pair of Carhartts for a week straight if not for the torrential downpours that frequent his home in Canaan Valley, W.Va. But as a contract trail builder for the Heart of the Highlands Trail System, Adams is not in it for the casual dress code. He’s in it for the art. 
 
“It’s super rewarding,” says Adams. “Creating a new build is my favorite part.” 
 
You need only ride a minute from the town of Davis, W.Va., to get a taste of his trails firsthand. Rock gardens, log piles, and other technical trail features are standard fare on Splashdam Connector, Adams’ most prized trail. So what goes into all of that glorious, techy riding? 
 
“We move a lot of muck and we move a lot of rocks,” Adams says, which, when you’re at it 40 hours a week in less-than-ideal weather, can be downright exhausting. 
 
Fortunately, Adams regularly employs the help of local AmeriCorps workers, volunteers, and, of course, a mini excavator and rogue hoe, his favorite tools. As a former cyclocross competitor and race organizer for his brainchild, Fast Forward Racing Productions, Adams knows the recipe for the perfect trail—“rocks, techy slow moves, fun flow sections…diversity, you know,” all of which he strives to include in his own builds or reconstructs. 
 
It’s unglamorous work at best. Often muddy, saturated, or overgrown, the trails and elements of Canaan Valley are a force to be reckoned with. But for Adams, no matter how many tons of rock he hauls, no matter how many thickets of mountain laurel he wrestles, any day in the woods is better than a day at the desk. Plus, who wouldn’t enjoy cruising the fruits of your labor after a hard day on the clock? 
 

 
MacKenzie Hatcher 
 
>> Photo boater, Laurel Highlands River Tours 
 
Ohiopyle, Penn. 
 
Imagine a kayak for a desk, a stomping class IV-V river for a daily commute, an afternoon rush hour packed with commercial rafts. For photo boater MacKenzie Hatcher, 21, that’s been her work reality since she was just 15 years old. And though she has to wear a skirt to work everyday, she wouldn’t have it any other way. 
 
“I love kayaking and really enjoy taking photos, so getting to combine those two things makes it the best job,” Hatcher says. 
 
Having grown up on the banks of the Youghigheny River in southwestern Pennsylvania, Hatcher, the daughter of river rat parents, has been kayaking for most of her life and shooting photos since high school. After attending the New River Academy, a traveling high school for kayakers that concentrates on videography and photography, Hatcher thought it only natural that she should continue her passions on her hometown river. 
 
“There’s a lot to it,” Hatcher says. “People think it’s an easy job,” but you try safely navigating your way solo through pods of rafts, or “floating undercuts,” amid technical whitewater, adjusting your camera settings to constantly changing light, and still creating consistently quality images without mishap. 
 
Hatcher’s pretty dialed in at this point, and most problems are usually just dead camera batteries or full memory cards, but there have been a few out-of-boat experiences that have left her more than shaken. 
 
“I also shoot photos on the Cheat River, and I once swam out of Big Nasty,” Hatcher says, recalling the class IV river was at high spring flows close to five feet. “I was by myself, but I somehow managed to get all of my gear to shore and still get photos of the trip coming down.” 
 
Short of kayaking and camera skills, photo boating requires a good deal of grit and a wild hair. Fortunately for Hatcher, she’s well endowed with both.

REAL TALK 
 
What would you be willing to do to have the job of your dreams? What does it take to be a professional climber or brand road warrior? Here is advice from our featured adventurers. 
 
1. BE WILLING : As in, be willing to forgo sleep, to be poor, to have people look at you like you’re crazy, to sometimes think you are crazy. Be willing to ride the peaks and valleys of chasing your passions. 
 
“That’s one of the biggest things,” Pat Goodman says. “Be willing to have everything go differently than you had planned it to and still be excited about the adventure.” 
 
2. LOVE YOUR PARENTS : Because hey, you got that knack for adventure somewhere, right? It also helps to have a good relationship with your folks in case, you know, your Kickstarter campaign falls flat on its face. Or when you need a staging area in between moves, like Eva Surls and her now-husband Cashion Smith did before moving to Brevard. 
 
“We moved in with my parents for eight months which I would never recommend to any adult couple,” Surls says. “I’m still recovering from that.” 
 
3. TRAVEL : You’re not gonna get inspired sitting on Google or scrolling through Instagram feeds. Get out there and see the world and find out where you want to fit into all of that. 
 
“My appreciation and drive for new things grows every time I travel,” says Emily Shanblatt. “It’s a lifelong mission.” 
 
4. BE YOUR OWN BOSS : If you’re going to create your future, you’re going to have to create your own boss, too. Make plans, and stick with them. More importantly, act the part. 
 
“Time management is so important,” Bryan Mangum says. “You can’t get bored. Find something to do and don’t take it for granted.” 
 
5. BE PERSONABLE : No matter how skilled you are, no matter if you’re the best photographer on the entire planet, if nobody likes you, nobody is going to hire you. 
 
“That’s why people come back [rafting],” MacKenzie Hatcher says. “It’s based on how personable you are and how much you make them feel welcome and give them a good time.” 
 
6. KEEP LEARNING : And don’t stop learning. Ever. Whether it’s through workshops or shadowing or interning or heck, even volunteering, build your skills and listen to those who came before you. 
 
“Get involved,” says Zach Adams. “Do it right from the start.”

Document Title: [REVIEW] Amy
Source: McMaster University Sil
Published on: 2015-08-13T17:56:59Z
Document Content: •  • Arts , Music , Pop Culture , Reviews 
 
If you haven’t seen the trailer for Amy yet, go watch it now. The recent documentary from director Asif Kapadia is a haunting sketch of the life of Amy Winehouse that revives her music for new fans, and gives former fans the second dose of Winehouse they had all been waiting for. 
 
The film traces the artist’s rise and fall from her teenage beginnings as a jazz club frequenter, to her international fame with the Grammy Award-winning Back to Black , and finally to her tragic overdose at the age of 27. 
 
With footage from home videos, television and radio interviews, and heartbreaking post-mortem interviews with her closest friends and relatives, the film gives an explicit glance into the tragic and not so uncommon life of a high-profile celebrity. 
 
As a longtime Amy Winehouse fan, I was unsure of what to expect from the film. My interest in her was mostly confined to her music, and I knew little about her life aside from her public battle with addiction and her death five years ago. 
 
While her music has clear reference to her struggles with mental illness, broken relationships and drug use, a clear portrait of her experiences has never before been available to the public. This glimpse into her life gives a new meaning to her lyrics that makes her music even more powerful than it was to begin with. 
 
Amy Winehouse grew up in London, England, where she started her career as a jazz singer. She lived in a middle-class home with a set of friends that would stick around until her last days. Her story does not sound uncommon or tragic when first told, but as she aged, fell into depression, became reliant on drugs and alcohol, and lived a life exploited by the public, a great talent grew smaller. 
 
A powerful aspect of the movie is its ability to couple Winehouse’s experiences with the corresponding music she wrote in those moments. The film will go into detail about a part of her life, such as the on-again off-again relationship with her eventual husband Blake, and follow the scene with a live recording of the song reflecting this time in her life. The documentary does a beautiful job at highlighting lyrics with elegant script up against record studio footage and scribbled poetry in notebooks. 
 
One of the most tragic parts of the film comes when hearing from her parents. They both noticed her depressive behavior, but shrugged it off as a passing phase as opposed to addressing it. Her mother was made aware of her daughter’s lifelong struggle with Bulimia when she was a teenager, but didn’t see anything wrong with the behavior until much later in her life. Her father acknowledges that his absence from home and the affair that kept him away from his family led to her early substance abuse, yet he never made an effort to get her help until it was too late. 
 
Seeing how the people closest to her reacted to her struggles was devastating. It all made her death seem inevetable rather than preventable. 
 
It would have been nice to see more about her early musical influences rather than just elements of her personal life, but the film does touch upon her young love of jazz and its influence on her first recordings. 
 
Previous fans as well as those unfamiliar with her music and story can enjoy the film. It is a well-made documentary that does a lot with found footage and conveys a tragic yet compelling story that any music fan would appreciate.

Help overturn this law that denigrates human and parental rights by helping get this law put up for a vote in a Ballot Referendum. Californians are working for a People’s Veto.

A Message from California Coalition for Vaccine Choice: “We are knee-deep in our ground battle to qualify the SB 277 Referendum for the November 2016 ballot. You are a fierce and motivated army who refuse to be cowed by a government bent on controlling you. You have built a strong network of allies and have garnered tremendous results. We’re in the homestretch now with less than 30 days to go and we need to back up your efforts with paid signature collectors. This egregious bill needs to go!”. “ By successfully qualifying the SB 277 Referendum, we will ALL send a resounding message that WE THE PEOPLE will not give up our freedoms without a fight “ A message from our legal staff at NHFA on CA SB277: SB277 fundamentally alters the relationship between government and citizens in CA! Californians would lose the essence of Diane Miller JD American liberty regarding their health choices. The government plans to coerce citizens into forced medical treatments by withholding the ability to attend schools if they do not comply.   Mass vaccination policies are made at the state level – where your action to protect your rights are urgently needed now!   Defend the right to make informed voluntary decisions about vaccinations.  Help overturn SB277!   Thank California Senators Voting to Protect Human Rights and who opposed SB277: Anderson, Bates, Fuller, Gaines, Leyva, Moorlach, Morrell, Nielsen, Roth, Runner, Huff.   Send This Alert to your California Contacts!   Click Here for NVIC, the National Vaccine Information Center   Click Here to read SB277 that repeals Californians’ right to a personal belief and religious exemption for the use of vaccines.

Document Title: Sierra Valley Museum of Medical History in Sacramento
Source: California Through My Lens
Published on: 2015-08-12T13:41:43Z
Document Content: When I was exploring Sacramento, I attempted to visit Sutter’s Fort but it happened to be closed for renovations when I was there. Since I had time to kill before my plane I scoured the internet for something else to do and stumbled upon this unique medical museum. I headed over to check it out and I was glad I did as it had a ton of fantastic and strange old medical tools and after visiting it made me happy to be living in the time that I currently do. Here is all the info. 
 

 
Details 
  Hours: Closed Sat-Sun, Mon-Fri: 9AM-4pM  Cost: Free  Location: 5380 Elvas Ave, Sacramento, CA 95819   

 
One of the best parts about this museum is that it is completely free. It does not appear to be super popular based on what one of the workers told me, but I found it to have a lot of interesting stuff, especially for a free museum. 
 

 
The museum itself is just in a hallway and one room on the bottom of a medical research facility. When you walk in, the first thing you will see is an old iron lung device that was used to help people with Polio. It was a crazy contraption, they even had marketing materials from the time period showing people using it.  
 

 
Next to that there are a lot of instruments in a glass case with the most interesting thing for me being the collection of different types of fake eyes.  
 

 
From here you can head across the hall into the main room of the museum where everything is located. The items on display include things ranging from an old nurse uniforms to wooden wheelchairs. It is overwhelming how much stuff they have. Below are a few photos. 
 

 

 

 
One of the most interesting things for me was seeing the area based on leeches. I have always found it pretty crazy that they used leeches in the past so I enjoyed reading about how there are still a few areas where they use leeches now as well.  
 

 
They also had a history of the bed pan in the corner, I doubt the history of the bedpan is on display in very many other places. 
 

 
Lastly, there was this big old dental cabinet against one wall. I am not even sure what the tools that go with the cabinet look like, but just the cabinet and the creepy doll mimicking a child, made me glad for the dentist I have. 
 

 
All in all I explored the Sierra Valley Museum of Medical History for about a half hour and learned a bunch of new things about medical tools. Sure, this is not for everyone, but it is a good free museum if you are looking to kill some time in Sacramento. Let me know your thoughts if you have been in the comments.

Document Title: Real Agent Guard launches program to keep agents safe on the job
Source: Financial News
Published on: 2015-08-31T21:24:01Z
Document Content: Real Agent Guard launches program to keep agents safe on the job By Gulli Arnason in Media and Technology · August 31, 2015 Real Agent Guard said it has launched a new platform that allows agents to find safe locations to meet with clients.
Often, agents are asked to meet with clients who want to see a property far from their home office. REALTORÂ® Safe Harbor is a web-based site and mobile-friendly app that enables agents to quickly determine safe locations to meet.
Several REALTORÂ® associations have recently signed on to be among the first groups to take part in the program, including the Arkansas REALTORÂ®s Association, 6,923 members; the Wyoming Association of REALTORÂ®s, 2,012 members; the Louisiana REALTORÂ®s Association, 11,650 members; and the Idaho Association of REALTORÂ®s, 7,000 members. Several other state associations are also close to finalizing partnerships with REALTORÂ® Safe Harbor.
All of the associations and Real Agent Guard are actively encouraging real estate firms and other businesses to offer their locations as a safe harbor.
Real Agent Guard, based in Rogers, Ark., is a mobile-enabled personal security service that provides real-time monitoring of employees or agents for the purpose of providing both monitoring and deterrence from potential personal attacks. 0saves Save If you enjoyed this post, please consider leaving a comment or subscribing to the RSS feed to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.

Document Title: Teachers: the resource students need most remains in short supply
Source: Press and Dakotan
Published on: 2015-08-31T05:00:00Z
Document Content: (BPT) - The role of teachers in today’s society cannot be understated. Outside of a child’s parents, teachers are often the primary adult influencers in a young person’s life. Yet this essential role is getting harder and harder to fill as school districts across the nation face significant teacher shortages according to the U.S. Department of Education. To counteract this critical problem, recruiting new talent to the profession has become a national priority. What shouldn’t be lost in the quest for teachers, however is the intrinsic rewards of influencing and educating young people. The educators of tomorrow must view teaching as a path toward improving lives, not simply as a means to meet the demand. 
  
Morale remains high 
 
The modern teacher shortage can be tied to many things - including a wave of retiring educators and national education funding challenges - but teacher morale does not appear to be an issue. Research shows that 88 percent of teachers are satisfied with their choice to become a teacher, according to a recent University of Phoenix College of Education survey of more than 1,000 K-12 teachers. Additionally, 68 percent of teachers, who entered the field in the past 10 years, say they would recommend the profession to others. Recent federal data supports these findings as well. Eighty-three percent of teachers who entered the field in 2008-2009 were still working in education five years later, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
 
Higher education’s role in preparing the next generation of teachers 
 
Efforts to grow the teaching ranks must focus on teacher recruitment, particularly in STEM subjects. Research also shows that expanding access to teacher preparation programs and providing prospective teachers with experience that will help them navigate the critical first few years in the classroom is essential. 
 
Higher education institutions play a vital role in ensuring potential candidates understand the opportunities that exist in education. Today’s teacher preparation programs must be able to accommodate modern student schedules and meet unique education needs. 
 
Teacher preparation programs that offer flexibility and relevance to the dynamics of today’s classrooms are a must for student success. In addition, the curriculum offered by higher education institutions should also provide today’s teacher candidates with real-world scenarios that encourage critical thinking and decision-making skills. These lessons will be vital when managing their own classrooms in the years ahead. 
 
Inspiring tomorrow’s teachers 
 
As most teachers will attest, they did not join the profession to get rich, but rather to inspire children and young adults to learn, set ambitious goals and achieve them. The University of Phoenix survey found that past generations of teachers were quite successful at this. Nearly half of respondents were inspired to join the profession by a teacher they had when they were young, according to the University of Phoenix survey. 
 
Recruiting, retaining and supporting the individuals who are so critical to the future of today’s children, takes a team effort. But the efforts are worth it as the successes of today’s teachers will ultimately translate into the victories of tomorrow’s leaders.

Document Title: GitHub Restores Service Following DDoS Attack
Source: The State of Security
Published on: 2015-08-26T10:43:41Z
Document Content: GitHub has successfully restored service to its users following a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack earlier this week. According to ZDNet, the site’s code repository, which hosts code ranging from security systems to application frameworks as well as data dumps, first detected connectivity issues at approximately 10:39 BST (05:39 EDT) on Tuesday morning. The service then launched an investigation to diagnose the ongoing problems. By 6:38 EDT, GitHub’s teams determined that the issues were due to a DDoS attack. “The connectivity problems have been identified as a DDoS attack,” reads an update posted on Tuesday to GitHub’s status page. “We’re working to mitigate now.” The status page reveals that the site’s restoration efforts lasted for two hours. By about 10:00 EDT, service had been completely restored. This is not the first time GitHub has suffered a DDoS attack. Back in October of 2013, the site reported downtime as a result of four separate DDoS assaults for just that month alone. More recently, the service came under what has been called the largest DDoS attack in its history back in March of this year. According to security researcher and blogger Anthr@x, the DDoS campaign lasted for more than 24 hours and presumably originated from the Chinese web services company Baidu. This site allegedly hijacked some of GitHub’s HTTP connections and replaced some Javascript files from Baidu with malicious ones. This tactic, in turn, redirected Internet traffic to GitHub pages operated by Greatfire.org, a Chinese anti-censorship website, and another mirroring a Chinese translation of The New York Times. An investigation later determined that this attack was connected to an earlier DDoS campaign conducted against Greatfire.org. “Millions of global internet users, visiting thousands of websites hosted inside and outside China, were randomly receiving malicious code which was used to launch cyberattacks against GreatFire.org’s websites,” the Great Fire analysis reveals. “Baidu’s Analytics code (h.js) was one of the files replaced by malicious code which triggered the attacks. Baidu Analytics, akin to Google Analytics, is used by thousands of websites. Any visitor to any website using Baidu Analytics or other Baidu resources would have been exposed to the malicious code.” At the time of this writing, GitHub appears to be functioning normally. Nevertheless, it remains unclear who is responsible for this latest attack and whether it is at all connected to the DDoS campaign that occurred against GitHub and Greatfire.org back in March.

Document Title: Fula Flute plays for the JJA Awards at the Blue Note, NYC
Source: InterMuse » InterMuse
Published on: 2015-08-18T19:03:01Z
Document Content: x  
Kudos to Howard Mandel for booking this act to open the Jazz Journalists Association Awards 2015 at the Blue Note Jazz Club. The focus of the evening was on Jazz piano, with Randy Weston receiving a lifetime achievement award, Women in Jazz (with Mimi Jones and Antoinette Montague performing) and African-Jazz ties (Fula Flute, made up of Bailo Bah –the master– and Sylvain Leroux, both playing the tambin.) 
I asked Sylvain to write about Fula Flute, and he was so eloquent, there was little for me to add: 
 
“Bailo and I have gone through many incarnations as Fula Flute and this time around we are going back to the fundamentals: the sound and energy of the tambin. Bailo and I have known and worked together since 1999—16 years now. We have gone through many phases and our relationship is strong. I consider him the way a martial arts student considers his master. I am good, but he is superior. However, although I am a student of his style of flute playing, I also have to some extent integrated the language of the Fula flute into my own expression which itself is informed with classical and jazz training and some wider World music experience and this gives me an ability to innovate in ways that he cannot. But it is very doubtful that I can ever approach his power, steeped as he is in the culture of his traditional village, located in the heart of the ancient and profound Fulani culture of Guinea, high in the mountains of the “Fouta Djallon.” 
 
In any case, I feel it is a privilege to be allowed to keep an accompaniment while he solos… to be like Noel Redding to Jimi Hendrix (to whom Bailo is often compared). Bailo respects me sufficiently to allow me to take solos and, from time to time, I play something that challenges him, which inevitably stimulates him to go further and then we see amazing fireworks as he is capable of playing at the highest level. He’s a “karamoko,” a sorcerer, and can generate real magic. Great African players are master of “nyama,” the life energy (kudalini, chi…) that they know how to stimulate and bring on the nirvanas that we experience as listeners. 
 
Bailo is an incredible person, he has had an amazing life—worth a book, at least—and is heir to profound knowledge, inherited as a child from his grandfather, of a rich but deeply different nature than what we normally refer to as “knowledge.” In his playing and in the message of the Fula flute is a hint of ancient ways that we would all be improved as a species if we integrated their lessons.” 
 
Well said, Sylvain!

Document Title: Opinions differ on how to move forward with new energy regulations; residents could be left in the dark
Source: Heritage News-Herald
Published on: 2015-08-14T20:53:52Z
Document Content: When new federal regulations kick in this year to reduce power plant emissions, a statewide energy crisis could loom.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is calling for a 32 percent reduction by 2030. In order to get there, several coal plants across Michigan will begin to close this year.In all, nine plants are expected to close over the next two years, with nothing currently planned to replace the energy they produce.Two units at the Trenton Channel Power Plant are among those that will close, along with two more south of the Downriver area at the J.R. Whiting plant near Luna Pier.DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris told The News-Herald Newspapers last year that the decision to close the units was a direct result of the new EPA regulations.“The decision was made because of new federal emissions' regulations taking effect in the next few years, and because of DTE’s focus on reducing customers' rates and maintaining competitive electric rates in the future," Berris said.The Wyandotte Municipal Power Plant uses a combination of ways to generate power, coal burning among them. The plant wasn’t on a shutdown list provided by the state of Michigan.No one from the plant was available to talk by press time for this report.Seven of the plants are owned by Consumers Energy and generate more than 950 megawatts of electricity. Overall, more than 1.3 daily gigawatts of power will need to be replaced after the plants all close.That amount would be enough to run Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing each day.Consumers Energy officials said they're doing their best to stretch resources to provide electricity to the state’s residents. Those efforts include reopening a Dearborn power plant and the $155 million purchase of the Juniper power plant in Jackson."You can't store electricity, so it's important to try and have a surplus of it," John Russell, president and CEO of Jackson-based Consumers Energy, said in a statement. "When customers hit the switch, they're either going to have it or they're not."Both political parties in the state have ideas on how to change regulations to help figure out the looming crisis.The GOP plan recently was released by Sen. Mike Nofs (R-Battle Creek), who chairs the state Senate Energy and Technology Committee.“This legislation represents hundreds of hours’ worth of research, discussion and input from numerous individuals, groups and organizations, including the governor, committee members and the 37-member workgroup I appointed last year,” Nofs said. “These bills represent a starting point for a thorough committee process that will ultimately help us craft the best policy to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for energy.”The Democrats' side is spearheaded by state Rep. Bill Lavoy (D-Monroe) and state Sen. Hoon-Young Hopgood (D-Taylor).“Through 2014, renewable energy projects have brought nearly $3 billion in investment to Michigan, and utilities are on track to meet the 10 percent goal required in current law,” LaVoy said. “As long as renewable energy remains economically viable, the percentage of power generation should increase. Additionally, increasing Michigan-based generation keeps jobs and investment in Michigan.”State Sen. David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and state Rep. Julie Plawecki (D-Dearborn Heights) also are working on the Democratic side of the aisle.The two plans are quite different.Nofs' plan calls for revamping the current integrated resource planning process to change the way utility companies are evaluated. The Republican plan hasn’t been well publicized since it officially was unveiled July 1.The Democratic plan has been on display and talked about since early March. It calls for an increase in support for clean energy-type businesses, with more focus on wind and solar energy companies.“We want to encourage companies to spend here in Michigan,” Knezek said. “Right now, there isn’t anything that restricts out- of-state buying of power. We don’t want that to remain unregulated.”Plawecki echoed those thoughts. She said if Michigan encourages companies to produce energy within the state, it will increase jobs and ultimately help the local economy.Since Michigan passed a renewable energy bill in 2008, more than $5 billion a year have been pumped into the state economy. About $3 billion of that has been invested by private-sector firms.Small-business owners claim the GOP plan for energy production moving forward will put a stop to much of that growth.“The Nofs' plan slams the brakes on Michigan’s clean energy sector, which has been a huge success, supporting 20,500 jobs and $5 billion in annual economic activity,” Mark Cryderman, business development/education manager of the Green Panel, said in a statement. “Polling consistently shows overwhelming support for increasing Michigan’s use of clean energy and the Michigan Legislature should be increasing our clean energy standards, not repealing them.”The Green Panel is a Brighton-based solar company that employs 30 people.State Rep. Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.), who co-authored much of the GOP plan, is against the changes at the federal level, but said he believes its plan is the best bet for the state.“The mandate that is being forced upon Michigan and the rest of the states by the federal government is an unprecedented overreach that will hinder job growth and raise energy rates on hardworking taxpayers," Nesbitt said in a statement. “We need an energy plan for the future that ensures reliability and efficiency, while being cost-effective for Michigan families.“The energy proposal I unveiled earlier this year is structured to take an ‘all of the above’ approach that considers each of those elements, rather than a narrow, cookie-cutter approach that picks winners and losers.”Hopgood believes the Democrats' plan is the way to go, both for clean energy and economic growth in the state.“This plan is pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-environment," he said. "Michigan has the potential to be a leader in renewable energy and create thousands of jobs for hardworking men and women across the state. That’s why it’s crucial that we act this year. With these energy principles, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to get to work.”There is overwhelming public support for increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to a poll conducted by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum in late 2013. Among the findings, the poll showed that more than 75 percent strongly support an increased renewable portfolio standard and 84 percent support more energy efficiency programs. The support extended to self-identified conservative voters.“With such strong public support from both ends of the political spectrum, it’s clear that this plan is the right way forward for Michigan’s energy sector and our economy,” LaVoy said. “I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to put these guidelines into action and create jobs while saving residents' money.”According to a report from The Hill Group, a renewable portfolio standard increase would generate as much as $6 billion in economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs. The Michigan Public Service Commission noted that in 2012 every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency saved consumers an estimated $3.83 in reduced energy costs.

Document Content: BAJA BOUND PART OF THE GREAT EXPERIENCE THAT IS THE 
 Punta Banda “GP” & the PURE UTV Events 
Ensenada, B.C. Mexico 
 
California City, CA – Aug 30, 2015 – AVE/Baja Promotions has secured special relationship with old time friend of the Gran Carrera days, Tim Morton. Morton, who heads up the BA JA BOUND Moto Tours in Baja for many years, is giving a lending hand to AVE/Baja Promotions by laying out an incredibly fun but challenging “GP courses for this year’s PUNTA BANDA GP & PURE UTV Events, Saturday, September 12. 
Morton merely suggested a few changes to the first event last May AND PROVED TO BE EXCELLENT. Not known for passing up on a good thing, AVE’s Lou Peralta, asked Tim to help out once again for the upcoming 10-mile GP course for Motorcycles. 
The results, according to promoter, Peralta are “fantastic! Tim really knows what the guys like and how to find those certain sections that will make each rider work a little harder. The idea is not to lay out a freeway but to give each racer a challenge. Nothing is impassible but it will certainly call on everyone’s ability to ride their bike.” 
 
Morton who does not like much attention is dedicated to motorcycles and has been all his life. His “tours” are world famous as he has participants from every corner of the earth. Moreover, he also takes on a few riders and supports them if they wish to race in any of the Baja races or in the states. He has the quality equipment, chase crew and experience to really show a neophyte or veteran in off-road racing, the necessary ropes to be competitive and to finish the events. 
 
This two-headed group combining Morton’s great experience in Baja and Peralta’s massive experience as a promoter since 1986, an individual who is still involved in the sport, make for what most consider a great combination. 
 
The next event is in September 12, at Punta Banda, which is part of the Ejido Coronel Esteban Cantu, where AVE/BP Racing has a multi-year contract to produce exclusively motorsports events. The event features motorcycles on Saturday at 10:00 am in a two-hour GP and a four-hour UTV race starting at approximately 1 p.m. on their own course. The UTV event is part of the 2015 PURE UTV OFF-ROAD DESERT SERIES where points are awarded according to Overall and Class positions. This event will also give out the Ensenada Cups to the Overall UTV and MC riders among the two Baja events. 
 
The general public in Baja is invited and entry into the Ejido and to watch this great event is only $50 Pesos per car load. What a Bargain! 
 
DP Racing has posted a $1000 prize, winner take-all for the Overall motorcycle at this event. 
 
Sponsors of the Series are DP Racing, the San Nicolas Hotel Casino, La Jolla Campground, Ejido Coronel Esteban Cantu, BUD LIGHT, Bibayoff Wines, Biba Pasion, Sonoco, Baja Bound Tours, Baja Bound Insurance, Fox, PCI, BP Graphics, Rugged Radios, Lazerstar, Sietesietesiete, IRC, Lawrence Motorsports, Lawrence Equipment, Supercharger Films, Can-Am, KC Hilites and Peralta Designs

Document Title: GREG ADLER AND TEAM 4 WHEEL PARTS IGNITE BAJA WITH LUCAS OIL OFF-ROAD
Source: race-deZert.com
Published on: 2015-08-07T18:51:29Z
Document Content: GREG ADLER AND TEAM 4 WHEEL PARTS IGNITE BAJA WITH LUCAS OIL OFF-ROAD 
 
Compton, California (August 5, 2015) – Ensenada, Mexico welcomed Greg Adler Motorsports and short course off-road racing this past weekend, as the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series made its much anticipated debut in the Baja California port city. The newly constructed facility on the grounds of the scenic Estero Beach Hotel and Resort featured a 1.1 mile course highlighting one of the longest straight-a-ways in short course off-road racing, along with deep, loose dirt that more closely resembled the sandy shores of Baja than the tightly compacted surface that competitors are accustomed to. 
 
As coastal breezes and capacity crowds enveloped Adler and Team 4 Wheel Parts, driver and team were quickly tasked with preparing the 900 HP #10 for battle. A full day of practice on Friday afternoon allowed Adler the opportunity to familiarize himself with the course and prepare for the weekend of Rounds 11 & 12 of Pro4 class warfare. 
 
Baja off-road competition traditionally equates to long distance endurance competitions with spectators rarely experiencing the event beyond a few quick seconds of vehicles passing by at high speed. The fan-friendly environment at Estero Beach delivered a level of access to the teams that attendees enthusiastically embraced, and as Adler and the team worked to find their footing on the challenging track, they arrived early and en masse to take in the sights and sounds of the event. 
 
“It was quite an experience,” said Adler. “Everyone here knows off-road racing but rarely do they have a chance to see the trucks without their fiberglass bodies on and the crew in action. It was exciting for us to have the opportunity to engage with the fans as they experienced short course off-road racing for the first time in Baja.” 
 
Saturday’s qualifying session put Adler on the second row to open up the weekend’s action and at the drop of the green flag, he found himself among the leaders. As the elite of off-road racing fought in the afternoon’s marquee event of the day, he continued to contend for a podium spot, at one time sitting as high as second. A wild restart following a yellow flag shuffled him into third, and with just a two laps to go, his chance at a trophy slipped away as he entered a corner while approaching the front straight. A competitor pushed just underneath him taking the position and at the checkered flag, Adler found himself in fourth, just two seconds outside of the third place spot. 
 
“This is a big, fast, wide open track,” he said, after the race. “These trucks are flying on this course and with a field as talented as this, just one slight mistake can be costly. The crew gave us a fast truck and it ran great. Now we just need to find that extra little bit to get us to the front.” 
 
Sunday’s Round 12 was less forgiving. While the group remained tight through the beginning of the race, Adler maintained a top-five position while fighting through the field. A mid-race incident brought out a caution flag and in the chaos of the ensuing restart, Adler was shuffled back into the pack. He maintained a face pace but with the loose dirt creating an enormous amount of “roost” from the truck in front of him, vision was at a premium. Resigned to bringing the truck safely home to preserve valuable points towards his season total, Adler finished the race in 8th place. 
 
“That was tough,” said Adler. “We were in the thick of the fight and after the restart we were three wide going into the corner. We got caught up with too many guys fighting for the same spot and it cost us. We finished and the truck was in great shape but we were running strong and would have been a lot happier coming home with a podium.” 
 
After a weekend of energetic, standing-room-only crowds, this inaugural event, a culmination of the efforts of Lucas Oil officials, Ensenada’s Ampudia family and the Estero Beach Hotel’s Gerardo Novelo and his family, was deemed a groundbreaking success as the series launched a new brand of off-road racing to the Baja California peninsula. 
 
“This was great for short course and great for the fans here in Baja,” said Adler. “Everyone was so welcoming and the entire experience was fantastic for our team. We’re already looking forward to coming back next year.” 
 
In just three short weeks, Greg Adler and the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series return to the high-flying Wild West Motorsports Park in Reno, Nevada. The series will also visit Las Vegas before the season comes to its conclusion in Lake Elsinore, California for the Lucas Oil Challenge Cup. Follow Greg Adler Motorsports on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Team4WheelParts.com. There’s nothing like live short course off-road racing action, but if you can’t be there to see it in person, the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series is broadcast throughout the season on CBS, the CBS Sports Network and MAVTV.

Document Title: Almshouse Road reopens as new traffic patterns are scheduled to begin on Route 263 in Warwick Township
Source: Newtown Advance
Published on: 2015-08-27T19:41:34Z
Document Content: WARWICK >> There's good news for motorists who use Almshouse Road. 

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) announced that Almshouse Road at Route 263 (York Road) in Warwick Township has reopened to traffic as of August 27. 

The reopening of Almshouse Road is associated with PennDOT’s $31.6 million project to reconstruct and improve four miles of Route 263 (York Road) between Bristol Road and Sugar Bottom Road in Warwick and Warminster townships. Construction began in March 2014 and is expected to finish in October 2017. 

Additionally, a new traffic pattern is scheduled to start Tuesday, September 1 on Route 263 (York Road) between Mill Road and Sugar Bottom Road in Warwick Township. 
 
PennDOT’s contractor will work Tuesday, Sept. 1 starting at 9 a.m. to move one lane of southbound and northbound traffic, plus a center turn lane, over to the newly constructed northbound side of Route 263 (York Road) so demolition and reconstruction can begin on the southbound side of the highway. 

Valley Road also will be partially closed starting Tuesday, September 1 through May 2016 for the rehabilitation of the adjacent bridge over Neshaminy Creek. Southbound Route 263 (York Road) motorists will be allowed to turn right onto Valley Road, but a left turn from northbound Route 263 (York Road) onto Valley Road, and a left turn from Valley Road onto northbound Route 263 (York Road) will be prohibited. 

PennDOT is rebuilding Route 263 to provide a smoother and safer roadway for motorists for decades to come. The improvements include full depth pavement reconstruction of the existing four-lane concrete road and intersection improvements. Crews will also rehabilitate the bridge over the Neshaminy Creek; rehabilitate the bridge that spans the Little Neshaminy Creek and Creek Road; improve drainage; install new traffic signal equipment, guiderail, signs and pavement markings; and relocate aerial and underground utilities. 

Northbound Route 263 (York Road) motorists who want to access Valley Road, and Valley Road motorists who want to travel north on Route 263 (York Road) will be detoured over Almshouse Road. 

The project to improve four miles of Route 263 (York Road) is financed with 100 percent federal funds. J.D. Eckman, Inc. of Atglen, Chester County, is the general contractor.

Chapter XIX

The long white corridors of the clinic will twisted his stomach.
Neatness, dry "inert" floral arrangements, the absence of aromas, of any kind and only minimal details reminded him he was in a not cozy place.
The only thing warm there, was rebel sun that filtered through the blinds, a few meters.

He crossed his legs. Waiting.

He did not know what was really happening. He did not suffer for his contusion, but apparently had some dark bumps in his memory, however, he told himself, if none of this affected his work or his family should not be alarmed.

Suddenly, the mischievous smile of John came yet again to his mind.
He realized that just thinking about him, his heart racing ... heck! What brought about this sudden change occurred in both? ... How would he carry these feelings without affecting his current life? ...

Does he was unfaithful to Linda?
 John assured him that no, always, even in the Asher time, this was never admitted as such ... They knew they were beyond the common relations between men and women, were united in various aspects and levels, and everything that happened among them, are born of the deep need of unification.
And he believed it.
Sometimes he saw himself as a coin, on one side, his life as it was exposed to the outside world, the pop star and his beautiful family ... and on the other side, John, his secret love, his weakness. And although they tried to keep this just between them, a handful persons knew almost certainly, he thought, George, Ringo ... Mike ...

After, their horrendous separation  ... years apart, learning to live without him and trying to rise from his own ashes ... until, no apparent reason, the encounter happens, passion, uncontrolled, again.

Should I now declare this to his inner circle, that is, Linda? ... Could she understand it? Suddenly he felt very insecure.
That would take time, he thought, to sort these sensitive issues.

Linda was walking towards him with an envelope and sealed several papers. In these cases, it is when he left her to take care, doctors, patients, and analysis procedures, were things that Paul preferred to avoid. She had insisted on checking to see the aftermath of the hit in his head and Paul had no choice, accompanied her as a child who will reluctantly behind his mother.

She motioned for him to go up and both entered the office of Dr. Cayce.
After the presentations, and see the results of the studies, Dr. had some doubts.

- Do you feel pain at some moment?

- Not at all - Paul reply, he wanted to leave the clinic as soon as possible.

- According to studies, there was no internal injury. But the hit has left marks that can be momentary or permanent - Dr. Cayce adjusted his glasses - I understand that you have trouble remembering ... certain things ... This is called Selective Amnesia.

- Is there a cure for that? - Linda asked, somewhat alarmed.

- There is treatment.... precise methods to exercise the lost memory. Sometimes the patient forgets inexplicably traumatic sequences and retrieves it  in the same way.

Paul paid attention to the latter.

- In that case, I do not know why it would be best to remember, perhaps the mind thus protects us from bad experiences - concluded Paul.

- It is one hypothesis, yes, but I think it is always better to know than  to ignore - Cayce answered - and if you ever need it, hypnosis is there, as highly efficient resource.

- I will have in mind, Dr. - Paul got up, held out his hand kindly to the  professional, looked rushed. Linda quickly picked up the papers and greet Cayce before leaving. Paul was in the hallway going to the exit.

- Wait a minute! - Linda said while she was trying to carrying the portfolio, the papers and jacket - Why such a hurry?

- Oh, sorry Lyn, George Martin is waiting for me  in the studio, I have a lot of work and chats to do with him . We have two full months to deal with the new songs.

- Great !!!... - Linda sighed, at least for a couple of months there would not travel to New York and they would "normally" to live  their lifes.
There no would be "John" on the horizon for now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

John, across the ocean, also had plans with his music.
Although he had never been very organized, nor practical, nor foresight now, he had planned to start working on songs for a new album. He had some material recorded on tape and much in the mind waiting to get out .

It seemed a miraculous revival. The emotional closeness with Paul and experiences in Bermuda had renewed her inspiration.
But above all the incredible epic in command of the ship, struggling  against fierce storm in front of him, and the fact that he could return unscathed and he could  save Paul,  was a hinge, and had returned part of their lost confidence in himself.

He felt with new strength and reason to follow, and their natural way of expressing was music.

Yoko saw this change in him, just he came back from his days off. And as usual, he was there to encourage him in what he wanted to do, more if it means he is far from Paul.

- I think Geffen Records is the place - she said hanging up the phone - this brochure Look, John, no doubt, is the best studio ...
John checked the pages and seemed happy with the photos, services and details of available technology.
 His situation was equally distant with Yoko, but at some point, he believed she was being flexible about let it be freer about his choices. Avoiding disputes. He knew she did not approve the days he spent with Paul, but neither said anything about it. Yoko, thinking, was the same woman that always.
Now, John believe, was the need to bring forward to this new album, like it or not, she was better than him to take commercial advantage. John knew she was his "necessary evil"

- Sounds good, when you have the finished material, perhaps opt for this study - said John.

Yoko was pleased, slowly, she is thinking regain control of their marriage, while John is recording, would not have Paul on the horizon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul's birthday was a special day, particularly festive.
Linda had arranged for part of the family of Paul who had long not come. Some cousins and their children, Mike and his family, and other close relatives gathered at his house and soon became a bustling party.

Paul looked happy, he had recovered his smile without shadows, like he had before the episode Japan. "Maybe forget, was a blessing, now," she thought.
She took a tray laden with snacks and went into the yard, when the phone rang in the room.

- Hello?

- Lyn? How nice to hear! - Warm voice of John.

- Oh, John, how you been? - She said cordially.

- Well, very good, I just wanted to say hello to Paul, if he's available, I hear several voices Clan McCartney out there! - He smiled

- I'd say they are all here and are enough! But I will look him ...

- Thank you!

Linda left the tube on the couch ... made three steps and she come back  to resume communication.

- John? Are you there? I meant something more ...

- Yes ... yes... What? - He asked intrigued.

- What exactly happened with you and him, on the boat ...?

John fell silent a few seconds ... almost disoriented . What the hell was that question?

- I do not understand ... Why do you ask?

Linda gained momentum. - Well, Paul came with a severe hit on his head, the doctor says he have amnesia about some issues that have lived ... and I realized he did not remember anything about Japan ... Do you understand!? ... Nothing at all! ... But I do not even know what happened on the boat ... What happened?

John thought and finally said.

- I'm sorry, look, he struck a door, there was a passing storm ... it was just that, I guess he did not tell you not to worry. But ... I want to know what else he has forgotten .... Now…. under the circumstances, I think it's better not remember the prison, was traumatic for him, you know.

- I thought the same, yes - Linda paused - but I do not like that he hide nothing to me, John, I'm strong, I can hear any truth, but, I assure you... I do not tolerate any lie.

John noticed a strange tone in his voice ... reproach?

- I'll get  for him - she finally said.

This was unexpected and revealing to John. Linda suspects? Her voice was straighter than in the past, Or she was just nervous? ... Mmm.
Also, Paul does not remember Japan,  therefore suffered no abuse there. Knowing how bad he felt about this ... forget, it was the best thing that could happen to him. Undoubtedly, nature was sometimes wise ...

- Hello Johnny! - Paul said cheerfully

- Happy birthday, old fox!

They talked bluntly about everything, including their musical projects. Both were with many plans for the future. John paused.

- What are you wearing, baby?

Paul smiled at the question.

 - Well ... a pink shirt with two buttons open top and gray pants ... - he said with sensual tone.

- Mmm ... imagine what would do my hand after opening another button ... - whispered John.

- Johnny! ... Do not do this now!

- Ok ... Luv ... But let me think that the next meeting between us, you will wear the same ... Yes?

- I think it's a good idea…

 Linda went back to the room heading to the kitchen for more snacks. She saw Paul still on the phone. He spoke smiling while playing with the cable of the device, screwing in his finger ... Linda recalled that the same was Heather when she spoke with her boyfriend ...

What would be what John was saying?

If she wished she could go to the room upstairs, now and pick up the other tube to hear the talk.
She looked at the stairs. She could. Should she...?
Maybe she  will.

John kept talking - Sorry, Linda asked me about your hit and I had to tell what happened about the storm on boat, and you did not want to worry ... Is it true you've forgotten ... certain things?

- So it seems I have forgotten experiences, I guess anything important, you know ... but I will not worry, I promise. I have much to think forward, backward left behind.

- I hope that does not include me, luv. -  joked John

- You're always in my future, no doubt - said laughing, Paul.

August, 1980

Yang was in his cell, reading for the hundredth time the last letter received by Paul.
Since he was gone, at least once a month received a letter from the former Beatle, telling his things, projects and asking how he was.
The latter was last May, which recounted how he had exalted in front of journalists, hitting one of them, thinking that threatened the life of John. He also said that June would make a trip to Central America, John and him, alone together, he was very happy, and also reminded to call him when finally left prison.

But Yang had no received letters since.

How would his things now? ... Would he have said to John about his terrible threat? ... Or perhaps Yang thought sadly, he's just busy with life and there is no time to write ...

- Yang !!!

The voice echoed through the corridors of the prison. Yang flinched from his bed in the cell. A guard was accompanied by a lawyer, the man greeted him respectfully, carrying a folder meticulously unfolded before him.

- Mr. Yang, I'm the state attorney appointed to inform the latest developments in your case.

- It's ... it's a pleasure ... What's new? - Yang said, something fearful.

The lawyer sought the precise clause between the roles of the folder and began to read.

... "And in view of the good behavior shown by the accused ..., who is serving actual conviction, we decided unanimously, that his departure scheduled for late October 1980 , ordering that as of August 15, 1980, is released and recover all his rights as a free citizen ... "- The man looked at him and smiled slightly - In five days you can go from here, Mr. Yang. You Is a completely free man.

Yang was paralyzed with joy. Finally ended his imprisonment, unfair, and could meet with his beloved family again. Some emotion tears
ran down her cheek , and hugged the lawyer, who did not expect this demonstration of joy.

- I'll be free again! - He shouted smiling.

And while he feel optimist, he had a thought filled with happiness to his friend Paul.
"I will call him!" ...

Published on: 2015-08-30T18:00:52Z
Document Content: I took inventory after emptying out my beach bag full of sand and surf and decided to clean out my medicine cabinet in preparation for the new season. I got rid of all of the old and half-used products and replaced them with several new and tested items that every man should give a try. The Art of Shaving, Orogold and Baxter of California made the list this month. #3: Your Beard Growing a full beard may think you look uber-masculine but it also sends a sign of mysterious insecurity. Shave it off. If you’ve kept the same style for over several years, it’s a protective gimmick and not showing your true self. Strangers will even pick up on this with their innate radar. The Art of Shaving has a Morris Park Collection. This line of razors will give you a close shave to reveal the true you. I suggest the royal blue razor and cartridge. http://www.theartofshaving.com #2: The Face Orogold has a product on the market called 24K Men’s Hydrating Moisturizer. Most men neglect this attention to their skin and after a summer of sun, wind and happy hour, the worst thing they can do is avoid maintenance of the largest organ on the body including the visage. The product contains 24K gold imported from Italy. After a close shave, this product protects and hydrates the skin for a fresh, healthy and youthful appearance. http://www.orogoldcosmetics.com #1: Neck Down The exfoliating body bar from Baxter of California is hands down the best soap bar that I’ve tried to date. It’s made for all skin types and contains cedar wood with dakmoss essence. What you really need to know is that granules will thoroughly remove skin problems that block pores and make it less healthy. I find this product to be helpful in maintaining a clean, masculine body. I recommend that you use it at least twice each week. The company recently teamed up with renaissance surfer Tyler Warren. Check out the collection box. http://www.baxterofcalifornia.com Originally published August 2015

Source: uautoknow.net
Published on: 2015-08-31T23:23:44Z
Document Content: The German automakers really know how to make Coupes such as the A5/S5 from Audi (updating soon), the 4- and 6-Series models from BMW, and from Mercedes Benz, the S-class Coupe and this latest C-Class Coupe. Mercedes is on a style roll with these coupes that look sleek, aerodynamic, and muscular/aggressive all at the same time. While the press release is a global one, you can guess the engines and equipment that will come to the US. Expect the turbo fours and the eight-speed auto at the very least. It would be nice to get the more-powerful diesel in the C-Class Coupe as well, but... The new C Coupe gets all of Mercedes' latest like the AMG equipment, Agility Control. Airmatic suspension, DISTRONIC PLUS (with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot), AS PLUS Brake Assist System, Active Lane Keeping Assist, PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection, and much more as standard equipment or available in packages. The new body is stiffer and lighter which should aid performance and fuel economy. In other words, like most Mercedes models here in the US, you can spend lots of money or go crazy with the options and spend even more money. But look what you get...a new Coupe that is certainly worth lusting after. Mercedes will begin the roll out of the new C-Class Coupes in December. For more info, check out the global press release and three videos after the jump. More to come...

Press Release:
The new C-Class Coupé: Seduction of the heart and mind
Mercedes-Benz is adding a Coupé to its C-Class family. Athletic and sporty, the vivid, sensual design of the new Coupé cuts a fine figure on the road and embodies modern luxury. At the same time, its interior raises elegance and style to a sporty level. A dynamically configured chassis, with optional air suspension, forms the basis for a high level of suspension comfort, low road roar and tyre vibration, agile handling, and driving pleasure. Lightweight construction to reduce weight, excellent aerodynamics and high-performance yet efficient engines likewise contribute to this. New assistance systems provide safety of the very highest calibre. With its high-class appeal and generous interior, the new C-Class Coupé sets new standards in its segment. It arrives in December 2015.
"Our new C-Class Coupé continues the philosophy of our exciting coupés. It combines thrilling design with agile sportiness and modern luxury. The C-Class Coupé therefore clearly pledges itself to stylish driving enjoyment," states Prof. Dr. Thomas Weber, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. As the sportiest variant of the C-Class, the Coupé displays its driving enjoyment-oriented character in an emotive and at the same time formally distinct design. A sportily striking front section featuring diamond radiator grille and long bonnet – the new Coupé is 60 millimetres longer than its predecessor between the firewall and front axle alone – gives way to a low greenhouse whose lines flow into a bold and powerful-looking rear end incorporating the Mercedes coupé genes. A high beltline and frameless doors with free-standing exterior mirrors underscore the sporty character. Clean lines and sensually arranged surfaces structure the side sections into vivid light and shadow effects. One particular highlight is the long drawn-out dropping line typical of a coupé. In contrast to the C-Class Saloon, the dropping line extends further past the rear wheel arch. To underscore the Coupé's sporty disposition, the suspension is 15 millimetres lower than that of the Saloon, making it a very sporty proposition when combined with the standard 17-inch tyres. Interior: generous, dynamic, exquisite
The interior is likewise a statement of the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy and combines emotion with intelligence. Although it exudes athletic and youthful charm, it has grown in maturity. Driver and passengers enjoy an ambience that leans toward the interior of the C-Class Saloon yet raises it to a new, sporty level. Flowing forms characterise the centre console as well as the door and rear side panelling, which smoothly merge into one another to emphasise the coupé character. The individually designed trim elements underscore the sporty character of the interior. A seating system including integral sports seats designed specifically for the Coupé offers sporty comfort. Plus there is an automatic belt feeder for added convenience. The choice of materials and the finish have a hand-crafted feel with high-class appeal and deliver a new take on modern luxury: sportiness without compromising on comfort and exquisite style. With an 80 millimetre longer wheelbase, the C-Class Coupé is 95 millimetres longer and 40 millimetres wider. The increased vehicle volume above all creates more spaciousness for the driver and front passenger. There is more shoulder room, elbow room and headroom in all seats. The unique position of the new C-Class Coupé is emphasised by the special upholstery colour combinations: saddle brown, porcelain and – in the Edition 1 – nut brown/black with turquoise topstitching. Individual highlights
The Coupé features a wealth of equipment as standard. The AMG Line is available as an alternative to further underline the dynamism of the Coupé. It differs by virtue of exterior features such as special bumpers and sills featuring AMG bodystyling, a diamond radiator grille with pins in chrome and 18-inch AMG light-alloy wheels. Interior highlights of the AMG Line include sportily exclusive touches such as upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre in black with contrasting topstitching, a multifunction sports steering wheel with flattened bottom section and AMG sports pedals. The trim in open-pore black ash, combined with aluminium in the dashboard and the doors, emphasises the look. Another eye-catching feature is the optional Interior Chrome package featuring numerous highlights shrouded in silver chrome, including the instrument cluster, the air vents and the door openers. Suspension – sportily agile and comfortable
The suspension offers a high level of comfort with low road roar and tyre vibration whilst ensuring agile driving dynamics – the basis for driving enjoyment. A new 4-link front axle with wheel suspension decoupled from the spring strut plays a part in the agile handling characteristics. This enables sporty axle kinematics for plenty of grip and high lateral stability. As a result, the suspension responds more sensitively to steering movements and allows a sporty, agile driving style. Multi-link independent rear suspension with 5 links ensures excellent wheel location qualities and supreme straight-line stability. The Coupé comes with steel suspension as standard. There are two variants with selective damping system available in conjunction with this suspension, each of which is 15 millimetres lower than on the Saloon:
Comfortable AGILITY CONTROL suspension with a sporty character Sports suspension with tauter springing and damping including Sports Direct-Steer system for even more agile handling Air suspension
The Coupé comes with the option of AIRMATIC air suspension on the front and rear axle. Its electronically controlled, continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axle ensures outstanding road roar and tyre vibration characteristics in every situation and gives the driver the option of selecting the desired driving style: sporty, comfortable or consumption-optimised. To this end, the driver can select one of five driving modes using the DYNAMIC SELECT Switch: "ECO", "Comfort", "Sport", "Sport +" and "Individual". Selecting "Individual" allows the driver to customise the vehicle settings. AIRMATIC also features all-round self-levelling for excellent ride comfort even with the vehicle loaded. Efficient and lively engines
Powerful and efficient four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines with ECO start/stop function provide for sporty performance and driving pleasure. All are compliant with the Euro 6 emissions standard. Compared with the predecessor they consume up to 20 percent less fuel. There are initially four petrol engines available for the Coupé. The power spectrum ranges from the 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine in the C 180 with 115 kW/156 hp to the two-litre C 200 (135 kW/184 hp) and C 250 (155 kW/211 hp) models and the C 300, likewise with a displacement of two litres but with an output of 180 kW/245 hp. The two diesel models are equipped with an enhanced four-cylinder unit developing 125 kW (170 hp) or 150 kW (204 hp) and feature ecofriendly SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction) for exhaust gas aftertreatment. Lighter, stiffer and stronger
Intelligent lightweight construction with a higher proportion of aluminium helps make the Coupé lighter than its predecessor. Light-alloy components include the wings, bonnet and boot lid. At the same time, the body is now much stiffer and stronger thanks to the use of high-strength materials, which has a positive effect on not only driving dynamics and noise levels but also crash safety. The Coupé therefore follows a Mercedes-Benz tradition in not only meeting all current national and international laws, but also all rating requirements as well as the more stringent internal Mercedes-Benz safety requirements, which are based on what actually happens in real-life accidents. Through the wind
Mercedes-Benz is setting the pace in the field of aerodynamics and delivers cars with the best drag coefficients (Cd values) in almost all vehicle classes. The new C‑Class Coupé boasts a Cd value of 0.26. This leading figure pays off above all when driving on country roads and motorways as wind resistance is greater than other forms of driving resistance at speeds above 70 km/h. Safe semi-autonomous driving to reduce stress
There are several safety and assistance systems based on the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive concept to choose from. ATTENTION ASSIST with adjustable sensitivity, which can warn the driver of inattentiveness and drowsiness, is included as standard. Further standard equipment includes COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS, which features an acoustic warning for the driver at speeds above 7 km/h and Adaptive Brake Assist to help avoid collisions by boosting the braking effect in line with the current situation. When a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 km/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles or, in the best-case scenario, even avoiding the collision altogether. At speeds of up to 50 km/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is thus able to help prevent rear-end collisions at up to 40 km/h. New assistance systems with substantially enhanced functions are optionally available, combining data from various sensor technologies such as radar sensors and a stereo camera as part of the Intelligent Drive concept to enhance comfort and safety:
DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot is an adaptive cruise control system that can adjust the speed of the vehicle in line with a slower-moving vehicle ahead in a speed range from 0 to 200 km/h if required. Likewise available from 0 to 200 km/h, steering intervention helps the driver stay in lane. And at speeds below 130 km/h, for example in traffic jams or when driving bumper to bumper, the system can follow the vehicle ahead even where there are no or unclear lane markings, thus enabling the driver to safety and comfortably follow the flow of traffic. As well as vehicles ahead and stationary vehicles, the BAS PLUS Brake Assist System can also detect crossing traffic and boost the braking force if the driver fails to apply the brakes sufficiently; in addition to slower-moving, stopping and stationary vehicles, the PRE-SAFE® Brake can even detect pedestrians and brake autonomously if the driver fails to react, thus preventing accidents up to 50 km/h and mitigating the severity of collisions at speeds of up to 72 km/h. In flowing traffic the PRE-SAFE® Brake provides assistance according to the same mode of operation throughout the speed range from 7 to 200 km/h. Enhanced Active Lane Keeping Assist can now also prevent the vehicle from unintentionally drifting out of lane by applying the brakes on one side when the lane markings are solid or broken and there is a risk of collision, e.g. as a result of vehicles overtaking at high speed, parallel traffic or even oncoming traffic. PRE-SAFE® PLUS extends the Intelligent Drive functions to take account of imminent rear impacts. It warns the following traffic by activating the rear hazard warning lights at increased frequency and initiating preventive PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection measures such as the reversible belt tensioner immediately prior to the impact. If the vehicle is stationary, the brakes are locked to reduce the forward jolt, which reduces the forces acting on the occupants and the risk of secondary collisions. The numerous assistance systems also include
Active Parking Assist, which enables semi-automated parking with active steering and brake intervention in both parallel and end-on parking spaces A 360° camera which is able to show the vehicle and its surroundings from various perspectives, including a virtual bird's-eye view, thus assisting with parking and manoeuvring Camera and navigation-based Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way warning function, which warns of speed limits and also alerts the driver to the start and end of no-overtaking zones and gives the driver a visual and audible warning if no-entry signs are detected Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, which allows the high-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the cone of light from the high-beam headlamps Airbags for safety
In addition to 3-point seat belts with pyrotechnical belt tensioning and belt-force limitation for driver, front passenger and rear passengers, numerous airbags serve to protect the vehicle's occupants in an accident. These include:
Frontal protection systems: Adaptive front airbags for driver and front passenger, additionally with a kneebag on the driver's side Side protection systems: Thorax/pelvisbags for driver and front passenger plus front and rear windowbags, with rear sidebags available as an option Climate control with satellite navigation
The air conditioning system in the new C-Class Coupé operates efficiently and ensures high air quality. As in the Saloon, it uses satellite navigation to detect tunnels. It therefore closes the air recirculation flap automatically when entering a tunnel and opens it again after exiting a tunnel. Vibrant infotainment experience
The new multimedia generation offers intuitive controls with visual animations and effects. Frontbass ensures a listening experience almost on a par with a concert hall – especially if the optionally available Burmester® sound system is specified. The Frontbass system uses the space within the cross-member and side member in the body structure as a resonance chamber for the bass speakers. The navigation system, which supplies the driver with precise traffic information in real time (Live Traffic Information), processes its contents interactively. Its features include an animated compass, a "Drive Show" with information for passengers similar to the on-screen presentations on board airliners and Google Maps displayed on the head unit. Extensive networking even in the basic version
A Bluetooth®-compatible mobile phone with data option is all it takes to make even the Audio 20 system internet-capable. This enables surfing the internet without restrictions when the vehicle is stationary. Mercedes-Benz Apps can be used while driving. Audio and video playback is possible from various sources. COMAND Online provides not only a larger display with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels, it also allows digital TV/radio reception and, in addition to many other features, offers fast hard-disc navigation, integral WLAN hotspot functionality and the LINGUATRONIC voice control system. The basic Audio 20 system as well as Audio 20 CD and COMAND Online all offer basic telephony as standard, which links up a mobile phone to the vehicle via a standardised Bluetooth® interface. Mercedes connect me: connected with the car
Like other models, the new C-Class Coupé has an extensive range of free Standard Services and Remote Online Services available as part of the "Mercedes connect me" package. Standard Services include automatic emergency call (eCall), Accident Recovery, breakdown assistance and after-sales service. The Remote Online services (standard with COMAND online and usable free of charge for the first three years) allow access to vehicle information at all times, including the status of windows and doors, mileage, tyre pressures and other diagnostic data. There is also a Vehicle Tracker function, remote door locking and unlocking, and remote auxiliary heating activation and deactivation.

Published on: 2015-08-21T13:48:44Z
Document Content: Give me any excuse to make pops and I’m game!! So when we decided, with all of our friends, to throw a giant picnic last weekend, I immediately figured out a way to bring Peaches ’n Cream pops to the main event!
These beauties are layered with roasted peaches, homemade streusel and an Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla/Greek Yogurt mixture that will make your heart sing! Everything combined together is sweet, tangy, fruity and ah-mazing. It’s the perfect refreshing bite to keep on hand for the rest of summer. Which, as we talked about before, I plan on extending through October And here’s the key to bringing them to a picnic – DESSERT FIRST! And a giant tub of ice to keep them frozen until it’s time to chow down!    
In case you don’t own 2394723984 billion ice pop molds and craft sticks like me, here are my favorites:

Peaches ’n Cream Pops
Ingredients1 pound peaches, pits removed and sliced into chunks1 teaspoon lemon juice1/2 cup honey, divided1 ½ cups Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla1/2 cup full fat Greek yogurt1 teaspoon pure vanilla extractsmall pinch fine sea salt
For the streusel1/2 cup flour2 ounces cold butter1/4 cup brown sugar1 teaspoon cinnamon
InstructionsPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the peaches in an even layer on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Drizzle with lemon juice. Roast until the peaches are soft and fragrant, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a bowl (including juices) and let cool to room-temperature.Make the streusel while the peaches are cooling. In a food processor, combine the flour, butter, sugar and cinnamon and pulse for a few seconds to break up the butter. Place the mixture on a parchment lined baking sheet and pat the mixture into a large cookie shape and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the streusel from the oven and let cool. Once cooled, break apart into crumbles.Add the roasted peaches and 1/4 cup honey to a food processor, and pulse once or twice to combine. The mixture should still be a be quite chunky.In a separate bowl, whisk together the Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla and the remaining 1/4 cup honey. Taste and adjust honey if you want it to be sweeter. Stir in the vanilla and salt until smooth.Spoon a tablespoon of the peach mixture into the bottom of each ice pop mold. Layer with a bit of the cream and another layer of the streusel. Continue layering until all the molds are evenly filled. Freeze until set, about 4-5 hours. After 30 minutes of freezing time, place a wooden craft stick in each pop, and continue freezing.To remove the pops: Place the popsicle mold in a large pot of warm water for 10-15 seconds, then pull gently on each pop stick until the pops release.

Document Title: Challenges of Pneumonectomy Surgery

Document Content: Challenges of Pneumonectomy Surgery
Published August 17, 2015 | By GRACE Video	Download PDF of this page
  Dr. Eric Vallières, thoracic surgeon, describes the phsycial challenges and risks for patients who undergo a pneumonectomy for lung cancer. Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 3:06 — 21.5MB) Download Transcript How Did You Like This Video?
Please feel free to offer comments and raise questions in our Discussion Forums.   Transcript The pneumonectomy, which I’ve described as when you remove the entire lung, for most patients is, physiologically, a bigger challenge. It is also a more risky operation; in general, patients who undergo a pneumonectomy — their risk of operative death, meaning dying as a result of surgery in the next 30 to 90 days, is three to four times higher than if they had only required a lobectomy. So the more lung you remove, the higher the risk. Now, that’s not true for everyone. If someone comes to us and they already have a tumor that is completely occluding their lung, and they’ve been living like this for months, for us to go in and remove that lung — they’ve already shown everyone, including themselves, that they don’t need that lung, they’re living fine. But for someone who is utilizing that lung, for a significant portion, and when in the operating room you just take it out in one swoop, that is a physiological challenge, and that’s something that we have to evaluate seriously. So the mortality is higher, and the complication rates of a pneumonectomy are also higher — two to three times higher, so it is a bigger challenge to take someone through a pneumonectomy short-term, and long-term. There is evidence now that there are a significant number of patients where they may survive the operation, but two years, three years, five years down the line, the fact that they only have one lung takes a toll on them, and there are some long-term issues for some patients — not all, but for some patients, in having undergone what’s called a pneumonectomy. Interestingly enough, a left pneumonectomy is not as challenging to the patient, nor to the surgeon, as a right pneumonectomy. Our right lung is a bigger lung, and losing your right lung, in general, it’s not universal, is more of a challenge that losing the left lung. There is an alternative for some patients to pneumonectomy, and that’s called a sleeve resection. Now, a sleeve resection is an operation where the tumor that you’re removing is fairly central, and what you do is you cut the airway above the tumor, cut the airway below the tumor, take out the tumor and the lobe — usually the upper lobe on either side, and then you reimplant the bottom part of the lung to where you cut things up. That’s a good alternative, oncologically — so as far as cancer results, it’s as good as a pneumonectomy. But it is physiologically, in the long run, a much better operation for the patients. Some patients who are considered for a pneumonectomy are candidates for these sleeve type of resections, which are done in centers of excellence, but that’s something to be aware of.

You can help me pay the bills by purchasing this useful and encouraging book!   Tom Reynolds, PhD   [powerpress] Shownotes: PART II
A conversation with Vulnerable Communion: A Theology of Disability and Hospitality, author Tom Reynolds   Bio:
Tom joined the Emmanuel College (part of the University of Toronto) faculty in 2007. He is committed to an interdisciplinary, practical, and relational vision of theology, and his teaching and research address a range of topics related to constructive theology (particularly the doctrine of God and theological anthropology), theological method, intercultural and interfaith engagements, contextual theologies and globalization, philosophical theology, disability studies, and the thought and influence of Friedrich Schleiermacher. His recent Articles Email: tom.reynolds@utoronto.ca MIN 00:30 Tom on Theodicy – The question of why does God allow suffering and how should we think about suffering. 1:00 How would Tom, as a theologian answer the question, “Why would a sovereign God allow a person to be born disabled and encounter such suffering?” 2:20 The Why questions and the answers are messy, ongoing, and evolving. These answers are limited and open to ongoing revision. 3:00 Reframing needed. Question the question and its suppositions about seeing suffering first and foremost as the issue. 3:40 If we are pitying a disabled person and seeing them how we would interpret suffering, we might be off base. 4:10 Exclusion as suffering. Social suffering is something we can alleviate as the church or community. 4:40 Tom on the central questions of Theodicy. 5:30 What would a good world be? Interdependent and that holds up the preciousness and fragility of life and human experience as valuable. Good things can be fragile things. 6:30 Does God cause suffering and determine it? Maybe it’s (all) unfolding for us in mysterious ways. 7:40 Book of John, chapter 9: The man born blind. Who sinned? (disciples of Jesus thinking of blindness as a curse) So the glory of God can be revealed. (What might that mean that we haven’t understood yet. [Lisa]) The story is less about curing the disabled and more about reveal Jesus’ power and legitimacy as the Messiah. 9:20 NT Wright author of Evil and the Justice of God (on the Problem of Evil) • God as the Incarnation steps into human suffering as a means to assuage it and also, in that, provides us a model for how to encounter it in the world ourselves, practically speaking. The answers to suffering can become “incarnational”, not cerebral and (held) at a distance. 12:00 The why questions signal a (good) unsettledness which can be productive… 12:20 1. God is bigger than our questions and we should feel free to engage in dialogue with God and each other about God. 2. And because it calls us to live into the world and the lives of people will engage who ask, “Where are you?” and we can be there in presence and not (just) with answers. 13:00 “being-with” (The heart of Incarnational living.) 13:30 In many cases God’s own presence is us to each other. 14:00 “Care isn’t so much “doing for” but “being with”.” 15:00 1 in 5 families regularly encounters a serious disability of some kind. 15:30 We (as a family) chose to continue to come to church even though it was sometimes messy so he (and everyone) could figure out how to make it work. (Lisa) 16:00 How can people in Christian Communities or leaders in Christian communities do better when it comes to being truly hospitable  and caring well for people with disabilities. 17:00 Training ministers to come along side is important. 17:30 In his mission and intro to Theology class, what is framed is practical wisdom lived out in relationships of caring regard with other people. (not in the academic halls or in isolation). 18:00 On developing the perception to see/understand differently and to see places where people have been harmed by certain ways of seeing these…like the healing narratives…illness as curses from God, or metaphors of seeing and hearing language and attitudes (able-ism) for example. 18:50 How to show consideration: Asking before you assist someone. Or asking how you can best help and not presuming that you know (or know better). Listen first, then do. 19:30 Ministry doesn’t have to be deficit-focused to the “needy”…but rather possibility focused. As all people of resources and gifts [are] welcome among the community…this turns things upside-down. 20:30 Think of people as sites of wisdom that help a community of belonging. 21:00 1 Cor 12:25 Members having the same care for one another. All can care and contribute. Living out the image of God with shared affinity. 22:00 Transformative and vulnerable communion within our communities…being together. 23:20 [There is] dignity in participation. (Lisa) Allowing people to serve along side means that we are equal. 25:40 Equality isn’t sameness. Difference doesn’t mean a hierarchy. 27:40 (Tom) Music is my therapeutic other life.   A Call for Help!

Published on: 2015-08-15T15:38:35Z
Document Content: Housing pornography has returned to Sydney. This is where your dinner party guests get really stimulated when discussing the explosion in house prices in the Emerald City and the wealth effect this represents for them. Better still, this particular coitus doesn’t seem as likely to be interrupted as soon as the other kind. If you don’t know what I am talking about, you’re clearly not a property swinger. Or over 40. Or living in Mosman. The party isn’t for you. The fact that access to housing wealth is increasingly unavailable to large sections of Sydney society might not concern Baby Boomers minting it and buying two, three or more homes while others cannot buy one. It should matter to state and federal leaders of all parties, as the result is intergenerational inequity. Inheritance is becoming the main road to home ownership in Sydney: does that sound very Australian to you?[…] Continue Reading – Source: The Sydney Morning Herald

(InGoal photo by Scott Slingsby) Washington Capitals’ netminder Justin Peters went under the knife on Monday, a procedure the club called “successful.” In a brief news release Washington said Peters underwent surgery on his left knee and they expected the 28-year old to be ready for training camp, though an official start date has not been announced. The Capitals first preseason game is against Florida on September 21st. Peters’ agent Jordan Neumann told the Washington Post Peters had been rehabilitating a sore knee that did not improve as expected, so they opted for surgery. “I would expect he’s doing everything in full gear, taking shots prior to the start of training camp,” Neumann said. “We expect him to be a full participant on day one of camp.” Peters played just 12 games for Washington last season – his first with the club after joining from Carolina – going 3-6-1 with a .881 save percentage and 3.25 goals against average. The Blyth, Ontario native is entering the final season of a two-year, one-way contract worth $950,000, and will be an unrestricted free agent next summer. he is expected to compete with German prospect Phillip Grubauer for the backup role behind recently re-signed No.1 Braden Holtby. Grubauer was selected ahead of Peters during the Eastern Conference quarter finals, when starter Braden Holtby was sidelined due to illness ahead of Game 2, and the 23-year old is considered a bright goaltending prospect. Grubauer’s emergence and new one-way contract suggest Peters may be AHL bound this season, but a return in time for training camp will at least allow him to compete for the backup role after a disappointing first year with the club.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government are pushing security bills through parliament that could send Japanese troops into conflict for the first time since World War Two, sparking massive protests around the country.Many with memories of the war and its aftermath are scathing about Abe’s steps away from Japan’s pacifist constitution in pursuit of a more robust security stance, and survivors of the bombing lambasted Abe at a meeting after the commemoration ceremony.

When the Wildcats played to their potential, they led 9-7. When they did not, things began to turn and turned in a hurry. It will be a focal point this week in practice for coach Steve Sims and the team following the 43-9 loss.

One of our family's favorite ways to connect is to share a travel adventure.

We stopped over in England to raise a glass with Cousin Nancy at The Eagle and Child, a favorite hangout of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Then on to Romania...

...Hungary...

...and Slovakia.

It was like stepping back in time.

In some places horse-drawn carts and hay wagons were almost as common as automobiles.

Travelers shared the road, no matter what their mode of conveyance.

During haying time in Romania...

...everyone seemed to be out working in the fields with their wooden rakes and hayforks.

Grandma and Grandpa too. 
While shepherds watched over their sheep, as they have done since time out of mind.

We visited beautiful villages...

...and cities.

We saw the ancient painted churches of Bucovina, designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

We tried some new things...

...met some new friends...

...and made memories which we shall enjoy for the rest of our lives.

It's thrilling to go out into the world, but just as wonderful to come home again.

We found a treasure or two on our travels, but the best souvenirs...

Thomas and I are heading to Germany in a week! It will be his first time to Europe and I’m pumped to bring him back to my kinda-sorta home! We spent a decent amount of time in Germany growing up because that’s where my family is from. We’ll be running around Southern Germany for 10 days but before we get there we have a loooooooong flight. In order to make it through without losing our minds, I’ll be bringing Double Chocolate Chip Caramel Cookies. It’s a take on my favorite trail mix which combines almonds, chocolate and little chocolate covered caramels – but I’ve turned them into cookies because it’s the right thing to do! Made with chocolate chips, chopped up caramels and Oven Roasted Sea Salt Blue Diamond Almonds and then dusted with Maldon sea salt for an extra punch of flavor – these really can’t be beat!

Website: www.shunyata.com The Shunyata Research TRITON v2, HYDRA TYPHON, HYDRA DPC-6 v2, and ΞTRON Sigma AC Power Cables represent the state-of-the art offerings from this well-known company that specializes in signal and power transfer products. These no-compromise products are created by Shunyata’s owner and chief designer, Caelin Gabriel; a man who has been steadily improving his company’s products since his first power conditioner offering in 2001. Shunyata Research’s products have not only been embraced by audiophiles, but by commercial recording studios, orchestras, and other commercial audio designers. The word Shunyata is a Sanskrit word that means the stillness or emptiness from which all creation emanates. all image credits: Shunyata Research The HYDRA TRITON V2 Design Elements and Philosophy
All power conditioners try to deal with the nose inherent on the AC supply line. But Caelin has identified two other issues that power conditioners should be dealing with to be successful in reducing noise and not degrade sound quality: Component to Component Interference (CCI) and Dynamic Transient Current Delivery (DTCD). The following are taken from Caelin’s discussion of these important topics: Component to Component Interference
Our audio components can generate noise that can be reflected back from the power conditioner to contaminate other components. Shunyata controls CCI without the use of transformers, coils or large capacitors that are inductive and can impede instantaneous current delivery. Grant Samuelsen, Director of Marketing and Sales at Shunyata Research, has stated that the TRITON is designed to provide localized “sinks” for system generated and radiated noise. Shunyata’s new CCI (Component-to-Component Interference) noise filters are a capacitive array applied to each outlet that prevents the spread of high-frequency noise between terminals. Dynamic Transient Current Delivery (DTCD)
Our audio components do not draw current in a constant or linear fashion. They draw current in instantaneous pulses as rectifiers switch on to fill the storage capacitors. This is not only found in high current devices, but in preamps and other low current components. These current pulses have high frequency harmonics up to 50 times the frequency of the AC power line. This places a great demand upon the AC power circuit and associated connections to deliver current without significant impedance to the flow. Impedence to these instantaneous current flow demands can cause a loss of phase and time coherence and degradation in voice and instrument weight with an overall compression of dynamics. DTCD Analysis
DTCD analysis is an important concept if one wishes to understand what is contributing to Shunyata Research’s design of their AC distribution products and AC cables. “DTCD is a method of current analysis that measures instantaneous current delivery in the context of a pulsed current draw. In layman's terms, it is a way of measuring current performance into typical electronic component power supplies.” “The DTCD Analyzer allows the measurement of pulsed transient current through a variety of AC power products, including power cords.” Shunyata Research optimizes their AC distribution centers and AC cables by using the DTCD Analyzer to improve and optimize performance. The TRITON v2 Features
NIC Noise Reduction
The Noise Isolation Chamber is a proprietary Shunyata Research technology that uses chambers filled with a ferroelectric substance that actually absorbs high frequency power line noise in the Megahertz to Gigahertz range. The substance used is patented ZrCa ferroelectric compound. ZPP-DS Distribution Buss
Zero-Point Power Distribution System (ZPP-DS) is a custom manufactured all-copper buss system linking all outlets to a single point of electrical contact. The power buss is made entirely from solid OFE (oxygen free electrolytic) Alloy 101 copper. Alloy 101 OFE Copper is the highest purity grade of copper at 99.99%. The ZPP-DS unifies the internal wiring, outlet contacts and power distribution buss into a single-point of electrical contact. This improves contact integrity and DTCD performance by eliminating many of the terminal connections and the daisy-chained wiring found in other products. CopperCONN Outlets
These new outlets introduced by Shunyata are made from solid, high purity, oxygen free copper contacts unlike most audiophile outlet contacts that are made from brass or bronze. These newly introduced CopperCONN outlets have excellent grip strength and contact integrity that contributes to a measurable improvement in Dynamic Transient Current Delivery. VTX Conductors
The VTX conductors are made in the shape of virtual tubes with a hollow core that minimizes skin effects and random eddy currents. Alloy 101 OFE Copper is used for these conductors. CCC - Computer Controlled Cryogenics
Shunyata Research operates their own Cryogenics International computer-controlled cryogenic plant to treat the wires, conductors and terminals used in the TRITON v2. Hydraulic Electromagnetic Breaker
Hydraulic electromagnetic breakers are used in the TRITON v2 as opposed to fuses or thermal breakers to deal with over current protection. Hydraulic electromagnetic breakers operate up to their current rating without voltage drops, increase contact impedance, thermal noise, excessive heat generation, and current limiting typically found in fuses and thermal breakers. "Trivial" Terminals
The small parts such as ring terminals, spades, bolts and washers used in the TRITON v2 are made by Shunyata using superior metals and plantings for each specific application in the TRITON. Chassis Dampening
Shunyata builds the TRITON v2 with heavy 16 gauge powder coated steel and a beautiful anodized aluminum faceplate that is now available in black. They include vibration absorbing materials such as energy absorbing footers, AC outlet gaskets and chassis dampeners that measurably reduce resonant vibration within the power distributor. This is one heavy, well-constructed component. In addition, optional stainless steel feet (SSF) that are milled from solid blocks of high-grade stainless steel are available for additional isolation when not placed on a dedicated shelf or amp stand. Chassis Ground System (CGS)
The TRITON v2 now come equipped with external grounding terminals capable of grounding any remote system component through the central Noise Isolation Chambers contained within each TRITON v2. Components used in Evaluation
The computer used was an Asus G501 JW running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Home 64 Bit. This laptop possesses an Intel Core i7 4720HQ 2.6 GHz Processor with 16GB RAM and a very fast PCI Express x4 SSD. The G501 JW computer also has a Thunderbolt port. Software included the latest version of Roon that supports Native DSD playback and Foobar2000. Fidelizer Pro 6.8 was also used in my listening evaluations. The computer was placed on a Synergistic Research Tranquility Base grounded with the Synergistic Research High Definition Ground Cable / Grounding Block as was the computer. Two 8 TB GRAID Thunderbolt Drives were connected; one for PCM and the other for DSD files. The GRAID Thunderbolt drives were powered by HDPlex linear power supplies. An UpTone Regen was also driven with an HDPlex linear power supply. A Synergistic Research Galileo LE USB cable and Audioquest Diamond USB cables connected the computer to the MSB DAC. The Asus G501 JW and the hard drives were plugged into a Shunyata Research HYDRA DPC-6 v2. The MSB Technology Analog DAC / Analog Power Base were plugged into the Shunyata Research TRITON v2 with an Σ SIGMA Digital IEC15 AC cable. My Ayre KX-R preamp was connected to the TRITON v2 with an Σ SIGMA ANALOG IEC15 AC cable. The power amps were Ayre MX-R monoblock amps with their AC connected directly to the wall using ΞTRON Σ SIGMA ANALOG IEC15 AC cables. Interconnect and speaker cables were Synergistic Research Atmosphere Level 4 cables. Speakers were Wilson Sasha and a Watchdog II subwoofer. The TRITON v2 was connected to the wall with an Σ SIGMA HIGH-CURRENT IEC 20 AC Cable. Sonic Impressions
I have listened to many power conditioners, including the Shunyata Research HYDRA V-Ray II and the HYDRA TRITON v1, but the HYDRA TRITON V2 provided a new acoustic experience for my music that was truly exemplary. The background silence was deep allowing fine detail and high end transients to emerge with outstanding clarity and definition. In fact, the reproduction of high end detail and transients were the best I have yet heard from any power conditioner. Many of the power conditioners I have listened to tend to smooth the end robbing it of its ultimate resolution. This effect might be pleasant to some listeners, but I consider it subtractive in nature. The HYDRA TRITON v2 reproduces voices and music in the most natural and relaxed manner I have yet experienced. This power conditioner strips away noise that adds a false and unnatural brightness to the music. Some might conclude that this brightness is better definition, but it does not sound like real music or voices. Once one experiences music with the TRITON v2, it is difficult to go back to the sound of noise superimposed on the music. I also experienced a more lifelike sense of instrumental body and weight with the TRITON v2. I was delighted with the soundstage qualities that were improved using the TRITON v2. Soundstage width extended well beyond the lateral margins of the speakers. The more difficult to reproduce depth is also enhanced with this power conditioner. Probably it would be more accurate to say that there is not enhancement, but reproduction of what is actually in the recording. The spatial resolution of well recorded music is truly world-class with the TRITON v2. The soundstage appears to be richly layered with immediacy and palpability. Bass reproduction though the TRITON v2 was not only well defined, but had wonderful weight and slam. The dynamic qualities of the music were reproduced with a terrific visceral grip on the bass. The deep-black ultra-quiet background of the TRITON v2 allowed superior resolution of low level information. Instrumental textures were clearly evident with a harmonic richness that I have not heard with other power conditioners. The TRITON v2 Chassis Ground System (CGS) and the CGS-10 Cable
The TRITON v2 has an internal ground-buss noise reduction system that uses the NIC technology. The new Chassis Ground System extends this noise-reduction system to components external to the TRITON. Potential ground loops can be eliminated with the use of a common grounding point for all components. The Shunyata Research CGS-10 ground cables are made of 10 gauge cryogenically treated CDA 101 copper. These are available from Shunyata at custom lengths. Unfortunately, I was unable to use the CGS with my Ayre MX-R amps that are plugged directly into the wall as Ayre lifts the ground in their design. But I was able to successfully test the CGS system on several other components using Shunyata’s new CGS-10 Ground Cables. I have an Uptone Audio USB Regen that is not powered from the TRITON v2. I decided to use the HDPlex linear power supply to power the USB Regen; a device that generates a new USB data signal for your DAC. I grounded the HDPlex chassis with the CGS-10 ground cable. The soundstage significantly increased in width after grounding the HDPlex to the TRITON v2. The imaging heard within the soundstage was better defined. The music seemed to be a little more dynamic in quality. A very nice and noticeable improvement in the ultimate performance of the MSB Analog DAC resulted from the use of the TRITON v2 Chassis Ground System with the Regen / HDPlex. Shunyata has told me that the grounding results will vary with different components. The TRITON v1 Compared to the TRITON v2
Caelin feels that the TRITON v2 is an evolutionary improvement to the previous TRITON model. The new TRITON v2 uses the new pure copper CopperCONN outlets, a new copper buss system, and new CCI noise filters. Shunyata felt that these three items were significant enough in sonic terms to justify a new version of the TRITON. While the NICs (noise isolation chambers) remain the same in v2 as in the original TRITON, the 4 external grounding posts connected to the noise isolation chambers adds a new versatility and potential for external (components not connected to the TRITON) component enhancement not found in the original TRITON. I was fortunate to have an original TRITON on hand to compare to the v2 model. After comparing the sound of both line conditioners to each other, I felt that the TRITON v2 was much better than the original version; so much so that I felt that Shunyata could have given it a new model name. Virtually every aspect of sonic performance was improved in the new model. The sonic improvements were so obvious, that I was quite amazed given the excellent sound of the original version. The TRITON v2 just takes the original TRITON’s performance to a significantly higher plane of performance with greater musical transparency. Shunyata Research offers an upgrade path for those that own the original TRITON. The upgrade includes 4 CopperCONN duplex outlets, the new OFE Copper ZPP-DS Buss Bars, 4 new CCI Modules, 4 outlet isolation gaskets, and a chassis damping retrofit. The only feature lacking in the upgraded TRITON v2 is the CGS Grounding System. The cost of the upgrade is $1900. Owners of the original TRITON should consider this upgrade as the sonic improvements will most assuredly impress them. The HYDRA TYPHON
When Caelin Gabriel set out to originally design the TRITON power distribution center, he came up with a no-compromise design that was much larger than the present TRITON v2 with significantly greater cost. A design decision was made to split the original TRITON into two units. The “ultimate TRITON” would now consist of a stand-alone 8 outlet Reference power distributor. The second chassis would plug into the base unit and function in parallel enhancing the power conditioning qualities of the Reference unit. The HYDRA TYPHON was the result of this design decision to split the ultimate TRITON into 2 manageable products. Shunyata Research’s description of the TYPHON: “Within the TYPHON’s TRITON-size case are two massive Noise Isolation Chambers (NIC’s). These cylindrical chambers take up the entire space within the TYPHON’s chassis and account for the majority of the TYPHON’s 43 pound weight. Each NIC contains an enormous volume of Shunyata’s patented ZrCa-2000 compound, which absorbs and dissipates high-frequency noise. Shunyata’s hollow-core VTX wiring, culled from ultra-pure OFC copper, runs through the chambers and connects to the IEC at the back of the TYPHON. In essence, the TYPHON is a purpose-built slave unit for the HYDRA TRITON.” The HYDRA TYPHON shares the cosmetics and external design of the TRITON and comes with a special AC cable that plugs into one of the TRITON’s unused outlets. This AC cable is optimized for maximum performance of the TYPHON with the TRITON. The TYPHON AHC AC cable has the following specifications: Length: 30 inches (76 cm)
Gauge: 7 AWG aggregate
Filter: Dual Hybrid ΞTRON
IEC-C19: Shunyata CopperCONN (UL Listed, CE Mark)
US NEMA P15: Shunyata CopperCONN (UL Listed) Materials include the similar 16 gauge power coated steel chassis, aluminum faceplate, and vibration isolation treatment / Shunyata Isolation Footers that are found in the TRITON v2. 9 AWG Shunyata VTX OFC Copper conductors are used in the TYPHON as well as Shunyata’s Cryogenic Treatment. The TYPHON works in parallel with the TRITON v2 and does not carry the current load of the TRITON. There is a recommended 5 day settling period to reach the optimum performance of the TYPHON’s NICs. If one wishes to have comparative listening sessions with the TYPHON, plugging and then unplugging the TYPHON in rapid succession will not allow one to accurately assess the contribution made by the TYPHON. The Sonic Contribution of the TYPHON
Adding a TYPHON to a TRITON v2 results in an improvement to the sound that is remarkable and easily heard. With the additional drop in the noise floor, small instrumental details are revealed that were previously obscrued. The soundstage is dramatically opened up with air and bloom around the instruments not previously observed. I am now hearing every inflection and nuance of a performance within this expanded soundstage. Soundstage width and depth increase with enhanced resolution of low level information on the recording. Quite frankly, the effect when first heard is uncanny. Little things like the sounds of fingers on a guitar fret board emerge where they were previously obscured by the noise floor. The addition of the TYPHON results in enhanced harmonic richness to instruments with richer timbre and texture. Quite simply put, you have no idea of what you aren’t hearing unless a TYPHON is connected to the TRITON v2. Listening to well-known recordings in my collection made me feel that I was listening to new hi-resolution copies of these recordings. After listening to the TYPHON for several weeks, I removed the TYPHON from the TRITON. All I can say is that the over-all performance dropped several bars and had a significant negative impact on the sound I was hearing. The TYPHON is really that good. ΞTRON Σ SIGMA AC Cables
The Sigma AC cables are Shunyata Research’s most advanced cables incorporating the highest performing ΞTRON circuits that reduce noise to the incoming component’s AC and isolate that noise from other components. Shunyata Research claims that the noise reduction circuits in the Sigma cable virtually eliminate CCI (Component-to-Component Interference) that serves to protect other components from commonly shared noise. These AC cables act as high current power conditioners. There are 3 versions of the cable that differ in the specific frequencies of noise that are canceled; Digital, Analog, and High-Current. The Sigma cables use Shunyata’s new CopperCONN connectors that have as their base metal pure Tellurium copper as opposed to brass that is commonly used in other audiophile AC cables. A very thin layer of nickel plating protects the copper from corrosion. But it is the copper base metal that carries the current. Shunyata is truly obsessive in the over-all design of these cables. They have also found that there is a negative impact on the sound if magnetic screws are used in the connector assembly. Pure stainless steel screws are used for the best sonic performance. All of the ΞTRON Σ SIGMA AC Cables share the following design: Certified CDA-101 Copper
VTX (virtual tube) Conductors
SHUNYATA CopperCONN CONNECTORS Pure OFC Copper Base Metal With Superior Conductivity Compared to Brass or Bronze
Nickel plated for corrosion protection
Superior Contact Grip
Shunyata Alpha Cryogenic Processed These are large diameter cables that employ 8 AWG VTX Conductors in the Analog and Digital Models with 6 AWG VTX Conductors for the High Current version. These graphs indicate the noise filtering of the ΞTRON Σ SIGMA AC Cables: The noise-filter elements used in the Σ SIGMA AC Cables are entirely passive and non-reactive, meaning they will never get in the way of current flow, nor will they interfere with the power supplies of the components. All versions are designed for maximum DTCD (Dynamic Transient Current Delivery). Shunyata pulls out the stops for packaging of these cables by placing them in a velvet bag inside a rigid flight case. The physical detail of the connectors and overall feel of the cable are first-class. A Very Revealing AC Cable
The Sigma Series of AC cables are the finest sounding cables I have had the opportunity to experience in my system. I used the Analog Version on each of my Ayre MX-R amps and KX-R preamp. The Digital Version was used on my MSB Technology Analog DAC / Analog Power Base. These are the most revealing AC cables I have heard that present music and voices in a relaxed, natural manner without accentuation of the lows, mids, or highs. I was impressed with the way that these cables handled female and male vocalists without bright or unnatural coloration. Substituting other audiophile AC cables for the Sigma Analog with the Ayre MX-Rs plugged directly into the wall, resulted in an increase in grain and hardness that was absent on the Sigma cables. These are state-of-the art cables in terms of transient detail, bass definition and impact, low level detail retrieval, and soundstage reproduction. The Sigma Series compliments the sound characteristics of the TRITON v2 and TYPHON and is highly recommended for use with these power distribution products. The HYDRA DPC-6 v2
After reviewing the HYDRA DPC-6 Digital Power Distribution Center last October, this product became an indispensable component in my system, The DPC-6 acts as a firewall to digital noise from computers, hard drives, routers, satellite receivers, products with SMPS, etc. The effectiveness of the DPC-6 was impressive in removing the noise that would otherwise contaminate one’s system and analog components. The new version of the DPC-6 builds on the previous version by now using the excellent CopperCONN outlets found on the TRITON V2. I heard an improvement in over-all detail retrieval and reduction of grain with the new CopperCONN outlets. Also, the physical grip of the CopperConn contacts is superior to that of the previously used SR-Z1 outlets that were built to Shunyata’s specifications by Hubbell. A New Musical Experience
Listening to my system with the full Shunyata stack of the TRITON v2, TYPHON, HYDRA DPC-6 v2, and the Sigma AC cables gave me a totally new perspective of well-known musical titles in my collection. Revisiting Cat Steven’s Tea for the Tillerman (DSD128) was a real treat listening to this Analogue Productions remastered version authored direct to native DSD from the analog tape. The Shunyata stack stripped away hardness and a subtle veil that moved Cat Steven’s voice forward in the soundstage with a wonderful relaxed presentation. For lack of a better description, I felt that there was now a more tube-like bloom and dimensionality to the recording. Masterpieces in Miniature, a recording performed by Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony (24/192) allowed me to experience just how good the full Shunyata stack was capable of resolving low-level information. Recorded and mixed to 192 kHz, 24 bit except for track 6 that was recorded to 96 kHz, 24 bit, this wonderful collection displayed an ultra-quiet background with rich tonal colors and life-like timbres. The Shunyata stack allowed me to hear a richly layered soundstage that had air and bloom around the instruments. I couldn’t believe how good Doug MacLeod’s new Reference Recording Exactly Like This sounded to me with the Shunyata stack. This excellent 24/176.4 Keith Johnson recording presented a new musical experience for me listening with the full complement of Shunyata power distribution equipment. It seemed that transient detail was now rendered with greater immediacy and clarity. I definitely heard more weight and body to MacLeod’s voice and better weight and slam to the bass. I never realized that I was previously hearing an electronic quality to the music prior to experiencing this title with the full Shunyata stack. I now felt that I was hearing resolution and transparency that was previously masked by overriding noise in my system. Audio Excellence That Must Be Experienced
My experience with the Shunyata Research HYDRA TRITON v2, HYDRA TYPHON, HYDRA DPC-6 v2, and the ΞTRON Σ SIGMA AC Cables forced me to reevaluate my previous conceptions of power conditioning and the contribution that AC cables bring to this task. In this review, I not only tried to relate the excellence of sonic performance exhibited by these power distribution products, but Shunyata Research’s dedication to design detail. Every component used to build these devices was scrutinized for their contribution to the overall design’s sonic result. I have no doubts that those of you with the financial means to purchase these products will be thrilled with the improvement they bring to your system. The full Shunyata Research high-end complement of power distribution products and AC Cables result in audio excellence that must be experienced for those seriously interested in applying power conditioning to their systems.

  A tunneled pleural catheter is an excellent way to manage the symptoms of a recurrent malignant pleural effusion. Dr. Jed Gorden describes how it is placed and how it works. Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 7:40 — 95.9MB) Download Transcript How Did You Like This Video?
Please feel free to offer comments and raise questions in our Discussion Forums.   Transcript So we’re talking today about pleural fluid — fluid that resides around the lung, in-between this space that we’re calling the double plastic bag. But what we’re talking about is the evolution from symptoms associated with pleural fluid, to diagnosis of the pleural fluid, to, now, how do we manage it long-term, because my goal for you is that you recognize that you have options for independence, and independent living despite the fact that the fluid may be building up. So what I’m going to talk to you about right now is called tunneled pleural catheters. Tunneled pleural catheters is a generic name, it is not like what you typically think about when drains are placed in the chest, and I want to sort of dispel that myth right up front, because often times when people are told, “well, we’re going to put a drain in,” people think about people that they’ve known who’ve had operations and have drains hanging out, and constant drainage. What I’m talking about is something that is designed that only you and your loved ones will have to know about, things that can allow you to go back to work, to enjoy sports and travel — things that really give you independence.  So what are these tunneled pleural catheters? They fall under many brand names, and depending on who your practitioner is, you may find that they may use something called PleurX, or they may use something called Aspira, or they may use something called Rockets (Rocket Medical) — they’re just different names all for the same thing. These are all devices that allow you to go home and manage your pleural fluid on your own. So, these are catheters that are typically placed in your side. We already know, when we put them in, a couple of really important things: number one, that you have pleural fluid, number two, that that pleural fluid comes back, and that unfortunately, that we can only temporarily relieve the symptoms, because until we have better treatments, at this time it is something that’s going to cause you symptoms, and that when you drain it, you get relief of those symptoms. So, that’s the triad that’s really important — that you have fluid, that the fluid recurs, and that if that fluid is drained, you get relief of your symptoms. If that triad is present, we need to come up with a system for you to live independently at home, and a common system that we use right now is placed in the side, and it’s the tunneled pleural catheter.  Typically these are placed in a sterile environment to minimize the risk of infection. We place them by ultrasound guidance, again, a safe way to identify the structures. We typically place them with you under a little bit of sedation — something to just take the edge off so you’re not aware of the surroundings. We instill a lot of local medications; typically we’ll put your arm behind your head and ultrasound in this plane right here on your side. The reason that we go into the side is because we don’t want you to have something in your back that does not allow you to lay in your bed, or sit on a chair, or drive a car and have pressure. We typically find that people have much more freedom when their side has a catheter and not their back.  The catheter is tunneled, just like the name says. That means that it goes under the skin, and then into the pleural space here on the side. There are specific advantages of that — that allows you to be at home with it, it minimizes the risk of infection, and it minimizes the catheter’s being dislodged, and it allows it to be more comfortably placed in the side pocket here. So, one end of this catheter is sitting within that fluid that’s in the chest — it’s in the plastic bag. When you’re not using these, when you’re at work, or like I have patients who play tennis, or golf, no one has to know you have this catheter. The catheter has a one-way valve on the end — that does not drip, it does not leak, it is wound up like a pretzel, there’s a gauze pad and a Tegaderm tape — the clear plastic bandages that you often see in the hospital, goes on top of it. That allows it to be on your side, and for you to be free to do what you want. The only restriction that we often ask is that you not go underwater, so it does limit scuba diving, snorkeling, hot tubs, and swimming, but other than that we encourage people to be active. The whole goal of this is for you to be out enjoying life; this is not a scenario that should make you feel home-bound — this should liberate you. The second advantage of these tunneled pleural catheters is that it gives you control back. So often with cancer, you’re reliant on your physicians — your oncologist, your pulmonologist, the nurses, the infusion center. The tunneled pleural catheter gives you and your loved one control over your pleural fluid. If you feel short of breath, you can drain your catheter. You don’t have to make a phone call to your doctor, you don’t have to go to the emergency room. The kit comes with vacuum bottles that hold between 500 cc’s and one liter, there are two sizes, typically for the vacuum ones — there are other kits that are slightly different. When it comes time to drain, you’ll be taught how to do simple, sterile technique. It is a very simple process that should not give you anxiety, but it will require a partner — it’s just an awkward location. And this allows your loved one to actually participate in your care and help you. The catheter and the drainage kit are hooked together, and the fluid is removed. This is the most important point here: the fluid that makes you feel better is what’s removed — never feel compelled to take as much fluid as you can. Sometimes people feel a little bit of pain as the fluid is being drained. The goal here is to remove fluid, have you feel better, relieve the symptoms, and get you back to doing what you want to do. You don’t get points for extra volume — draining a liter is not better than draining 500 cc’s if it’s just going to make you uncomfortable. When you’re done with that drainage, it’s taped back up, and you go about your business. So how often do you drain? It’s a common question that we’re asked. Well, typically what we do is we put people on a schedule. We say, “listen, we want you to be proactive. I don’t want you to wait until you’re short of breath. My goal is actually for you never to feel better when you drain your pleural catheter because you never allowed enough fluid to build up, and that you were ahead of it, and you maintained an excellent performance status.” So we start off typically with draining about every three days, and that may vary depending on how much fluid you build up, but from there you should feel comfortable coming up with a schedule that works for you. So these are not like taking blood pressure medications or chemotherapy that you need to adhere to a rigid schedule. Remember, this is your home device for you to feel better, and you get control over when you want to drain that catheter. So what are other things that you should feel free to do? Well, despite the fact that you have something in your side and I said you couldn’t take a bath, you’ll be happy to know that you could, and should, take showers, right? So, you should freely allow fluid and water to run over the bandage, or take the bandage off and allow fluid to run, as long as it’s dry before you rebandage it. So most of the activities that you do normally, you should feel free to continue doing. So the goal for you and your practitioner once you’re identified as having pleural fluid is not to have a conversation about how often you’re going to have your pleural fluid drained, but how few times you’re going to have to come to the hospital and have this managed, and when can you get on with managing this at home, and not have to keep coming back and having to deal with it.

Document Title: Virginia TV shooting: NRA tells grieving parents not to be 'emotional'
Source: Merredin Wheatbelt Mercury
Published on: 2015-08-31T23:27:40Z
Document Content: A prominent National Rifle Association advocate's 10-minute video suggests the parents of the reporters killed on air not be "emotional" in calling for gun control. 

Television journalists shot in on-air attack Washington: A prominent National Rifle Association advocate has released a 10-minute video message in which he suggests the parents of the reporters killed on air in Virginia last Wednesday not be "emotional" in calling for gun control.

The statement was made by Colion​ Noir, who fronts an NRA web video program designed to appeal to young people.

"To the parents of Alison Parker and Adam Ward, I have no right to tell any parent how to grieve for their child," Mr Noir says in the video.

"Grief-inspired advocacy can be extremely effective and powerful and I say run full speed to find the way to end violence like this.

"However, sometimes in a fight we can become so emotional that everyone and everything starts looking like the enemy even when they are there to help us. I am deeply sorry for your loss."

The video also includes a broadside at Australia's gun laws, with footage of an unnamed man warning that Australia has lost "its freedoms" due to an overreaction to gun violence. US President Barack Obama has previously . So far this video appears to be the most significant response by the NRA to the murder of the two journalists, shot dead live on air by a disgruntled former colleague, who also shot and wounded their interview subject.

On Sunday Parker's parents appeared on CNN and vowed to fight for increased gun control in her memory.

"Alison would be really mad at me if I didn't take this on," her father Andy Parker said. "And I promise you, these people are messing with the wrong family. We are going to effect a change."

Parker's mother, Barbara, said she was not discouraged that other prominent shootings had not yet prompted change, or that those who opposed new gun control measures were so well funded and organised.

"There are people out there whose minds we will never change," she said. "If you are a parent, if you are a mother, if you have children – how can you look your child in the eye and say 'we are willing to allow you to be collateral damage in order to keep what some people perceive to be their constitutional rights'. If we as a society are willing to accept that, what kind of society are we?"

In a separate interview, Mr Parker said he had already been in contact with other gun control advocates, including Mike Kelly, the astronaut whose wife, congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head in a mass shooting, to see how to help push "sensible gun control legislation".

Mr Parker authored an opinion piece published on Sunday reiterating that he plans to make his life's work "trying to implement effective and reasonable safeguards against this happening again".

Officially the NRA's response was silence, though it has used its growing in-house media arm to respond to calls for increased gun control made by, among others, US President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's frontrunner for the next year's presidential election.

Hours after the murders, NRA radio personality Cam Edwards, host of a program called Cam & Company, complained the shootings were already being used to promote an anti-gun agenda.

"It has been really disheartening to see in a matter of minutes how this story became politicised," Mr Edwards said.

"This is a community that is absolutely heartbroken right now and you've got people who are trying to turn this tragedy into some sort of political advantage for them[selves]. I just think it's gross."

He went on to call new gun laws "the wrong response to take here. I think it shows a lack of shared humanity".

Mr Noir was even more aggressive in the video.

"Let's face it, the gun issue is nothing less than low hanging fruit for Hillary and the rest of the gun control zealots," he says.

"She can stand on top of the gun control issue, beat her chest and make it sound like she is talking about something, when she is not, and it is getting disrespectful that you think American people are that stupid."

In an allusion to the controversy over Ms Clinton's use of a personal email server as secretary of state, he adds: "So do me a favour, take all of those useless gun control laws, type them up in a neat little email and then delete them."

Of the man who killed Parker and Mr Ward, he says, "This man's issue wasn't a gun, the same way a morbidly obese person's isn't a spoon or fork."

Mr Noir is not an official spokesman for the NRA, but a paid advocate who hosts a YouTube channel with more than 313,000 subscribers.

A self-described "urban gun enthusiast " in his early 30s, he has become one of the most visible faces for an organisation that is usually associated with, as he puts it, "old fat white guys".

Mr Noir, whose real name is Collins Idehen, is a native of Houston, Texas, and a practising attorney who earned his law degree from Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law.

His show – called Noir – is designed to appeal to minorities and young people, two demographics that do not show great support for the NRA.

The NRA has been contacted for comment.

Document Title: Hiking (and Photographing) the John Muir Trail
Source: Freshly Pressed: Editors' Picks
Published on: 2015-08-25T05:27:22Z
Document Content: “Mountains seem to answer an increasing imaginative need in the West. More and more people are discovering a desire for them, and a powerful solace in them. At bottom, mountains, like all wildernesses, challenge our complacent conviction – so easy to lapse into – that the world has been made for humans by humans. Most of us exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed and controlled. One forgets that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Mountains correct this amnesia. By speaking of greater forces than we can possibly invoke, and by confronting us with greater spans of time than we can possibly envisage, mountains refute our excessive trust in the man-made. They pose profound questions about our durability and the importance of our schemes. They induce, I suppose, a modesty in us.”  ― Robert Macfarlane

We returned to the John Muir Trail by heading back over Kearsarge Pass after a resupply. We made it just in time to avoid the storm on the way out, and were heading back to the trail with nothing but dry skies in the forecast. From the Kearsarge Pass trailhead, the path leads downhill towards Bubbs Creek and Vidette Meadow. We got a really early start on this day and stumbled upon a buck sleeping just off of the trail. The landscape here is dominated by the beautiful East Vidette Peak. I would love to come back here someday soon and make the scramble up to the summit. 
 
East Vidette Peak 
 
After reaching the end of the downhill hiking, we reached a flat section that meandered through the forest. It quickly began to climb, and we found ourselves looking out onto the beautiful Upper Vidette Meadow. The tree cover diminished as we gained elevation when we reached the 10,000ft elevation sign. I was excited for the next seven miles that would take us to Forester Pass at 13,110ft. 
 
Entering the Meadow 
 
Onto The Water 
 
Our next point of interest was Center Basin Creek. It was a special moment to cross the creek, and look out onto a granite wonderland without the interruption of a forest. For the first time, I could see just how high we would be climbing in order to get to the pass. We had a number of switchbacks to climb, so I began the process I’ve come to love so much, putting one foot in front of the other. My footsteps had become the metronome for the song of my life. My breathing was in perfect harmony. 
 
Beginning to Climb 
 
Looking Back 
 
Green Life 
 
We continued climbing up the wall of talus with the pass in sight. I was amazed at how in tune my lungs were with the surrounding air. I knew the oxygen levels were low, but my legs and lungs didn’t seem to notice. I was hiking at a pace usually reserved for low elevation climbs. I truly had my trail legs now. 
 
The Pass In Sight 
 
Alpine Lake 
 
Before I knew it, we were standing on the border of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. The views were absolutely spectacular at Forester Pass. We took some time to enjoy the landscape, and struck up a conversation with a few other hikers. 
 
At The Pass 
 
Looking North 
 
We began the descent from Forester Pass and it hit me just how big this day was going to be. Our goal was to reach Guitar Lake to set ourselves up for an early morning summit of Mt. Whitney. We had already hiked close to 10 miles with 3600ft of elevation gain, and we still had 16 miles to go if we wanted to reach our planned destination. Motivation came easy, as my heart and mind were intoxicated with the beauty of the Sierra, the peace of the trail, and the adrenaline from crossing a high pass. 
 
Looking South 
 
On The Trail 
 
There were a number of beautiful lakes in view as we lost elevation and pressed onward. At the end of the downhill, we crossed a large creek and then began a winding uphill climb on the side of a hill. Towards the end of the uphill climb, the landscape started to resemble what I’ve come to know as Hollywood’s interpretation of a Martian landscape. I knew that meant we had made it to the Bighorn Plateau. It was here that I got my first glimpse of Mt. Whitney from the East. 
 
On The Plateau 
 
Views of Whitney 
 
After the plateau, the trail once again headed downhill, this time to the Wright Creek drainage. There was a lot of shade in this area, and the day was turning out to be a warm one. At this point, we were only a few miles away from hitting 20 on the day, and my feet were starting to let me know. I feel like I can hike uphill for an eternity, but downhills beat my legs and feet up in a way that always leaves me praying for a swift end to all descents. We took a break near the water and gave our legs a chance to rest before making the final ascent of the day towards Guitar Lake. 
 
Final Downhill 
 
The final stretch of hiking for this day was a rather pleasant one, as the trail was shaded, and paralleled a creek for quite some time. The trail really started to level out as we reached Timberline Lake, and it was at that point we knew we were very close. Julia and I were both moving pretty slow at this point, but knowing how close we were to the finish kept our spirits high. 
 
Timberline Lake 
 
Approaching Guitar Lake 
 
When we finally arrived at Guitar Lake, we were surprised by how many tents were in the area. We had read to expect a crowd, but this was something completely unlike anything we had seen on the trail thus far. Much like Thousand Island Lake, I had to go searching for a great tent site. I’ve learned in my years of hiking, that heading uphill onto rocky surfaces will get you away from most people. The key is finding a place to pitch. It worked like a charm again this time, as I was able to find a perfect spot that had no one around.  I had packed an extra days worth of food incase were didn’t make it to Guitar Lake in one day. For the first time on the JMT, I had a true feast. It was so nice to gorge on two days worth of food for dinner! 
 
Guitar Lake 
 
The only downside to camping at Guitar Lake was being hit by the realization that this would be my final night on the John Muir Trail. Much like the night before reaching Santiago when I walked the Camino, the excitement I held in my heart was bittersweet. After reaching Mt. Whitney, the journey would be over.

“No matter how careful you are, there’s going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn’t experience it all. There’s that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should’ve been paying attention.Well, get used to that feeling. That’s how your whole life will feel some day. This is all practice.” ― Chuck Palahniuk

Document Title: Obama’s Balancing Act: Climate Change And Arctic Drilling
Source: OilPrice.com
Published on: 2015-08-31T21:24:32Z
Document Content: President Obama kicked off a multiday visit to Alaska on August 31, with the intention of highlighting the effects of climate change unfolding in real-time. He will point to the shrinking ice, rising sea levels, land erosion, and melting permafrost as evidence that the world must act to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
 
Alaska is bearing the brunt of climate change worse than other parts of the world. “This is an issue that is very here and now,” Brian Deese, a top climate advisor to Obama, told reporters ahead of the President’s visit. “The issue of climate change is not an issue of the future tense in Alaska. It is affecting people in their lives and livelihoods in real ways.” 
 
At the same time, not too far from his visit, is a major Arctic oil project that his administration just approved, underscoring the contradictions within the U.S. government about fossil fuel production and the need to address climate change.

“It’s inconsistent on the one hand for President Obama to lead the world toward comprehensive action on climate change, while on the other allowing companies to pursue difficult, expensive oil in dangerous and remote places,” Michael LeVine, senior counsel for environmental group Oceana, told the New York Times . 
 
The timing is indeed a bit awkward. Royal Dutch Shell is in the midst of drilling campaign in the Chukchi Sea, which Obama’s Interior Department recently green-lighted. Shell has a tight window in which to drill. By the time Shell’s icebreaker completed repairs in Portland, OR, managed to navigate through Greenpeace protestors , and arrived on site, Shell was left with little margin for error. The Anglo-Dutch company will essentially have just August and September to drill in the Burger prospect, before it has to shut operations down for the winter. 
 
Acknowledging his approval of Shell’s drilling plans, Obama argued in his weekly radio address that he wants the nation to move beyond fossil fuels – in Anchorage on Monday he called for aggressive action on climate change – but that in the interim, while the nation is still hooked on oil and gas, it would be better to produce domestically than to import.

There is strong environmental opposition to Arctic drilling, and protests were held in Anchorage in response to Obama’s visit. But there is also a lot of pressure at the state level to expand oil and gas drilling in Alaska. At issue is the state’s overwhelming dependence on oil production for its economy, and state revenues have been battered by the twin calamities of falling oil production and collapsing prices. Moreover, the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, which runs 800 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to the state’s southern coast, is running dry due to falling oil production. Oil flows in the pipeline are declining by about 5 percent per year. 
 
“We have an oil pipeline that’s two-thirds empty,” Alaska’s Governor Bill Walker, told Bloomberg. “It’s easy for people to predict what will or won’t happen, but as governor I can’t take that chance. Right now, about 75 percent of our revenue comes from that oil pipeline.” To make matters worse, the pipeline becomes more difficult to operate when oil flows drop below a certain level. More pump stations will likely be needed to keep up pipeline pressure if oil flows fall below 300,000 barrels per day. Thus, for the Alaskan government, declining oil production is an urgent problem. “I think that he’ll have a better appreciation when he’s up here, kind of what the need is in Alaska,” the state’s governor said.

Meanwhile, Shell is facing some pretty harsh conditions in the Arctic. On August 28, the company was forced to halt drilling operations because of high winds. But even if Shell is successful with its drilling operations in the Chukchi Sea, the company doesn’t expect to bring oil online until the end of the next decade. 
 
Taking all of these competing interests into account, the President is trying to pull off a tough balancing act. But another factor to consider is the possibility that the White House is losing enthusiasm for Arctic drilling behind the scenes, even while the administration approved Shell’s permits and the President continues to justify his government’s actions. The National Journal reported on August 28 that the Interior Department has not started work on the environmental assessment for the Arctic drilling leases that it is expected to auction off in 2016. 
 
Since that process can take two years to complete, there appears to be a growing possibility that the auction could be delayed or cancelled. If that were to happen, any new acreage would not be sold until the next administration. And if the next President is a Democrat, Arctic drilling could be shelved altogether given the candidates’ outspoken opposition to the idea.

Document Title: Ciara Talks Celibacy And Dating Double Standards
Source: Jocks And Stiletto Jill
Published on: 2015-08-19T18:30:48Z
Document Content: Ciara sat down with CBS This Morning on Wednesday. Naturally the conversation turned to her relationship with Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson. 
 

 
Ciara has been catching heat from her ex-fiance, rapper Future, and fans because of her decision to allow Wilson around she and Future’s one-year old son. 
 

 
Many felt it was too early in her relationship to have Baby Future around Russell. Ciara says that this is a double standard. She pointed out that Future has four children and she was around them early into their relationship. She also says she attempted to set up a meeting between Future and Russell but Future declined. 
 
Ciara also goes on to discuss she and Russell’s decision to practice celibacy. Cici says it’s difficult, but great sex would just be the cherry on top of their relationship. 
 
I think Future’s ego is a tad bruised that Ciara upgraded to a guy richer than he is.
